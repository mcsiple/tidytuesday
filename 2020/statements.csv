American University,,6,6,https://www.american.edu/president/announcements/may-31-2020.cfm,"Dear AU Community, 

I am usually a measured person, I believe that focus and hard work brings change, but today that is not enough. I write to you sad, frustrated, and angry. The horrific acts of violence against Black communities break our hearts. I just want to scream STOP! The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery lay bare the deep wounds of racism that have plagued our country for too long. My heart goes out to everyone hurting from these unacceptable tragedies and the centuries of injustice they represent.

The anguish in so many communities is the effect of systemic racism that tears at the fabric of our society. We have experienced this pain firsthand on our campus. We know we have more work to do to combat racism and foster inclusive excellence. We have to listen, to live our values through active anti-racist practices, and to confront all forms of discrimination, bigotry, and hatred in our society.

While COVID-19 makes it difficult for us to gather and address this heartbreak together, we are here for our community. If you need support, please reach out to our university resources, including the Dean of Students' office, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, the Kay Spiritual Life Center, the Counseling Center, and the Faculty/Staff Assistance Program (FSAP).

While the journey toward a more just society is demanding, we must each take steps that propel us all forward. At American University, our educational and research mission, our committed faculty and staff, and our students give us the opportunity and the obligation to take up this challenge. We will build on the work of our scholars who engage on the problems of racism, criminal justice reform, and societal disparities. We must take responsibility to educate ourselves and others about the issues and structures that perpetuate racism so we can work to change them. We will listen and learn from those who have experienced these tragedies and who live with the fear and pain of racism every day. And we must reject the fear and violence that some would use to further divide us.In these overwhelming times, please take care of yourselves and each other. Let us acknowledge the pain so many are feeling and find ways to support the Black community. Let us remember those who have suffered and lost from racism and hatred. And let us find strength in our shared humanity and our hope for justice.

Be safe and be well.

Amherst College,,6,6,https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/president/statements/node/771455,"Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, and Alumni, 

This morning‘s celebration of our graduates offered a reprieve from the horror, deep sadness, and rage I feel about the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the much longer list of unarmed black men, women, trans and nonbinary people whose lives have been taken by police officers or apparent vigilantes. The virulent anti-black racism in this country has never NOT been obvious, and yet there are those who continue to deny it. And there are clearly those who propagate it. Over the past several years, overt avowals and defenses of white supremacy have been more frequent, having been given license by statements and tweets at the highest levels of government. When I say that the pandemic has made racism even more glaringly obvious, as I did at this morning’s event, I am making a plea, to white people, in particular, to acknowledge the reality of anti-black racism, its long history, and its current force; to recognize how embedded it is in our institutional structures, social systems, and cultural norms; and to assume our responsibility for ending it. 
On behalf of the College, I condemn racial hatred, violence, and injustice. I know that many of you are peacefully protesting these most recent killings and the history of which they are a part. Many of you will be creating educational opportunities and offering support to our black students, staff, faculty, alumni and families. They live with the fear, rage, and sorrow that these killings are bound to bring up. Those of us who are white need to risk more and resist the assumption that this is someone else‘s responsibility. Whose, if not ours? The fact of anti-black racism in America is clear. No amount of outright lying or chaos-producing disinformation can change the truth of it. None of the obvious efforts to erode the very possibility of truth and destroy a shared knowledge of reality will deter us from speaking truth. 

We know from our black students and many of their allies that we have not done enough at the College to ensure their freedom from racist bias, even racist acts, much less to ensure their sense of belonging and equal ownership of the culture and life of the College. We have a great deal of work to do here at home. It begins, as it must, with truthfulness when faced with the evidence of our shortcomings. We also have to act—and act together as a community. There is so much at stake in this moment—our humanity, our democracy, and our planet. What a truly great country this could be if the privileges enjoyed by those who happen to be white were instead opportunities available to everyone. But we have not advanced to the point when black Americans can take their safety for granted, or assume they will enjoy equal opportunity, or get justice. So we have a very long way to go. 

I look forward to working with all of you.

Appalachian State University,,1,2,https://police.appstate.edu/statement-from-chief-stephenson-05-30-20,"As an officer of the law for more than 24 years, I am angered, sickened and ashamed by the actions of the police officers who are responsible for the death of George Floyd. I have felt compelled to apologize for those members of my profession who have yet to understand, or are not capable of understanding, what policing is meant to be. 

Policing is much more than simply the enforcement of laws. What matters most is the manner in which police officers interact with members of our communities. Policing must transition to a profession that attracts the brightest minds. Police officers must be actively engaged in building stronger communities, together with every member of the communities they serve. 

I know I have to go beyond apologizing, beyond talking, and take action. 

I view our App State Police academy program as a means for introducing reform into the communities of North Carolina, and beyond. Our young police officers need education and training that goes well beyond the minimum state training standards, both in the number of training hours and the topics of mandated instruction. Unless we engage and employ innovative new strategies, policing will continue to be destined for failure. This change begins with education. 

I feel extremely fortunate that I have been able to begin this work in the short time that I’ve been at Appalachian State University. Policing has always been controversial, and our university leadership has supported the work I have wanted to do to enact change. As we graduate officers with new standards of education, training and a clear understanding of their role in the communities they serve, our university police department is changing. Our officers have made some errors in judgment, but we are becoming a better department, better officers of the law, and most importantly, better stewards for our community, each day. 

We pledge to continue our work as a department, and the work of our academy, to change our profession so that police are truly protecting and serving every member of the communities in which they live.

Our nation is hurting. For the last few months, we have hurt physically, financially and otherwise from the coronavirus. Now, recent events of racial injustice are hurting us in many ways that words often find inadequate to fully express. While we acknowledge the painful reality that prejudice and bigotry exist, we stand resolute that they have no place in the Auburn Family.

Augustana University,,6,6,http://augie.edu/news/augustana-university-statement-concerning-racial-injustice-and-recent-events,"As a Christian institution, we believe our faith compels us to speak out against violence, injustice and oppression.

In addition to a global pandemic, the first half of 2020 has seen yet another spate of senseless and tragic deaths of unarmed black men and women in different communities across our country. Four months ago, Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed while jogging in Brunswick, Georgia, and, just last week, in our neighboring state of Minnesota, George Floyd, after repeatedly telling police he couldn’t breathe, died lying face down and handcuffed in the street.

Augustana University acknowledges the pain and anguish of the Black community when such heart-wrenching racial and social injustices occur and reoccur. The videos of these events are so very difficult to watch and result in varying degrees of trauma for all of us. We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized to these horrific events. While difficult, we must have the important conversations about these events and systemic racism with our children, our friends, our colleagues and others in our community. 

At Augustana, students enter to learn and leave to serve. To serve the neighbor. In a diverse world. Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd were our neighbors, made in the image of God. We grieve their deaths. And we extend our love and prayers to their families, and to our colleagues, students and friends who are people of color—who experience the pain, anger and sorrow of these tragic events far more deeply because of shared lived experiences that all of us must try to understand and respect more deeply.

On behalf of Augustana University, we reaffirm our campus and community commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and to social justice. This commitment is reflective of our Core Values and our common institutional calling with other ELCA colleges and universities to educate students who are called and empowered to serve the neighbor so all may flourish. We are a dedicated partner with those who seek to mobilize our broader community in support of meaningful actions that work to end systemic racism. 

We are called to come alongside all who suffer. May God’s love inspire action that helps mend these wounds and lifts up those around us.

Babson College,,3,3,https://entrepreneurship.babson.edu/community-message-6-1/,"Dear Babson Community:
Last week, the world witnessed an appalling act of violence in Minneapolis. The death of George Floyd represents the latest in a long, horrific, unacceptable pattern of unequal treatment and violence against the black community. We are reminded yet again of the toll that hatred and systemic racism can exact on our communities, nation and world—and the disproportionate impact on black communities and lives. Like many of you, we are angry, frustrated, and heartbroken.

This incident highlights important and disturbing concerns about institutional racism and violence in our society. As entrepreneurial leaders, we are driven to solve problems, to lead with empathy, and to create solutions to complex systemic challenges. It is our responsibility to discuss and explore these issues, to listen and learn, to confront our own biases, and to speak out and lead change.

Babson is continually working to improve equity and inclusion. We are enriched by a diversity of races, cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives, and united by a shared vision to create positive change in the world. This incident is a stark reminder that we must do more. As individuals and as a community, we must hold ourselves accountable to be actively anti-racist.

Pursuing equity and inclusive excellence at Babson continues to be an ongoing and important part of our collective mission. Babson’s Diversity and Inclusion Council, under the leadership of Sadie Burton-Goss, Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, leads much of this important work on campus and is a tremendous resource for our community. The Council plans to communicate with our community members the resources and support services we continue to offer to be an ally to colleagues, classmates, and society.

We must continuously ask ourselves: What will I do, in my own way, to become more aware of my own biases and the impact of that behavior? Every day, we should model and show respect, be accountable for our actions, and engage each other with compassion. Peaceful protests lead to new ways forward. Our mission is to be the leaders of the change we seek.

We are one community, supporting each other through an unimaginable time. One Babson. Thank you for your leadership, strength, and resilience.

Barnard College,,6,6,https://barnard.edu/news/denouncing-anti-black-violence,"Dear Members of the Barnard Community,

Although we are not physically together at the moment, I have seen so many ways in the past several months in which the Barnard community has stepped up to support one another — even in the darkest moments of loss on our campus and in our community. It is in this spirit of support that I write to you today to denounce, in the strongest possible form, the anti-Black violence and rhetoric that is currently unfolding across the nation. 

The recent killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and others serve as horrific reminders of how structural racism is enacted in this country. The pain that these injustices inflict, especially to members of the black community, is immeasurable. And that these atrocities have occurred during the current pandemic, which has disproportionately affected people of color, only adds to the distress. The fact that people of all ethnicities are gathering in protest, even while many states are just beginning the process of a gradual reopening, further demonstrates the pain inflicted by the inequalities that continue to plague our society.

Barnard is an institution that aims to interrogate racism and systematic discrimination in all its forms and to produce knowledge and actions that help address entrenched disparities in our society. One example is the work being done at the Barnard Center for Research on Women around interrupting criminalization and transformative justice. I encourage you to learn about and get involved in this important work that we are fortunate to have at Barnard. 

Every institution, including our own, has work to do here. Our educational mission demands that we speak up when we see violence against other human beings and relentlessly commit to the creation of a more just society.

There are resources available to you in these difficult times. Students can call Furman Counseling Center at 212-854-2092 for consultation and referral to counseling resources in their local community during the summer months. Faculty and staff can make use of our Employee Assistance Program through Humana at 800-448-4358. 

I also encourage you to look for ways to support black communities and those in need across the nation. Vice President of DEI Ariana González Stokas, the Barnard Center for Research on Women, the Athena Center for Leadership, and Barnard SGA are all sources of information and have resources you can access.

There are moments in history that test who we are and what we stand for. There are many ways to struggle for justice. There are many ways to express solidarity. The first is to commit to anti-racism and to find, even in small ways, how we can contribute in our own work toward racial justice and equality.

Please take care of yourself and each other during these challenging times.

Bentley University,,3,3,https://www.bentley.edu/news/living-our-values-difficult-times,"Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, 

The last few months of living in quarantine has been a life-altering experience for all of us. While we’ve adapted to learning, teaching and working remotely, the global pandemic has upended our daily routines, experiences and conventions. Like many of you, I closely follow the impact of COVID-19 on our community, commonwealth and nation. The grim milestone of 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 reminds us all of the toll this virus has taken on individuals and families. Personally, I’ve tried to balance the moments of frustration in isolation with walks around campus and the neighborhood, and time away from the computer screen, unwinding at home with my husband and sons. But “balance” has been particularly hard to achieve in recent days. 

George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor were men and women with families and friends, careers and hobbies, and hopes and aspirations. George went to the store. Ahmaud went for a jog. Breonna was at home. Their lives were like those of many other men and women of color in America, including those in our own Bentley community. Deep-seated, systemic racism and violence meant George, Ahmaud and Breonna were in life-threatening — and life-ending — situations because of the color of their skin. So many people of color across this country endure prejudice, intolerance, bias and bigotry every day while undertaking ordinary activities. It happens in Minnesota, Georgia and Kentucky, but it also happens in Massachusetts, in Waltham, and in every one of our communities. These recent incidents have reminded us that it is incumbent upon all of us to stand up against injustice and intolerance, whenever and wherever we see it. The nationwide protests that have erupted over the past few days have left me both anxious and inspired. It is difficult to see my hometown of Minneapolis in flames, especially so near to family and friends. And yet, it is inspiring to see people take action against injustice, including my friend Joan Gabel, president of the University of Minnesota, who severed ties with the Minneapolis police department last week. This unprecedented action sends a strong message that acts of brutality and violence against people of color will not be tolerated.",No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,,
Berry College,,5,5,https://www.berry.edu/about/office-of-the-president/memory-george-floyd,"Dear Berry Community:

It is a raw and disturbing image: the knee of a white police officer pressing against the neck of a black man lying face down on the pavement. The image records a bitter truth: the officer and his colleagues ignoring George Floyd as he pleads over and over that he cannot breathe, until he loses consciousness.

This image has galvanized our nation because it also symbolizes a long and brutal history: the knee of the white establishment pressed hard against the necks of black men and women. For decades, people of color have pleaded that the structures imposed on their communities have made it impossible for them to breathe freely. Too often, those in positions of authority and power have ignored or responded superficially to their appeals for help and fairness.

Those of us in the white community sometimes look with disapproval at these appeals because they take a form that we judge unacceptable. Rosa Parks takes a seat at the front of a bus. Colin Kaepernick takes a knee during the National Anthem. A crowd chants in Lafayette Park. We take offense. But before we condemn the methods of those who protest, we should first think hard about the injustice of silence and those three officers who said nothing while George Floyd cried out desperately for help.

The cries of anguish we hear from our African-American friends and neighbors are genuine and heart-wrenching. I heard one commentator say that every black parent he knew could not help but picture the face of their own son or daughter under that knee. That’s a perspective I needed to hear and consider repentantly.

This summer at Berry is uncommonly quiet. In many ways, it seems a tranquil harbor, a place of safety. Even here, however, we need to be attentive to the undercurrents of distress. For the last several years, a group of students has organized “Solidarity Week,” a series of events designed to facilitate conversation and insight about uncomfortable issues related to race and difference. Last fall’s event included a chapel service of lament, a time of truth-telling and remorse. I was particularly moved by one student, a well-liked athlete, who spoke of his difficult high school years in a Georgia community and how glad he was to be at a place like Berry where he was accepted and respected. But even at Berry, it turned out, he experienced moments of real pain and frustration as friends categorized him in certain ways simply because he was black. It was a troubling insight. Many of us experience Berry as a warm and caring place, but we must not take that for granted. We must help make it so for others as well, no matter our apparent differences, no matter our color.

A month ago, I read an essay by Lecrae, the recording artist and songwriter, discussing the importance of listening to one another’s stories. “The stories we share,” he wrote, “are not simply about facts and propositions. Sharing stories means sharing emotions and rendering ourselves vulnerable to others. And we can recognize the full range of emotions in our stories. Constructive anger leads to passionately fighting for the rights of the marginalized; destructive anger leads to burning buildings and rioting.”

Lecrae asks us to listen to others even when we find their stories disturbing. His words were written many months before the events of this past week. Anticipating a moment such as this, he explains: “it’s actually easier for us to believe a false narrative that fits our outlook on the world than a true narrative that shakes and shatters our perspective. And that is true regardless of where we stand.” That applies to you and me alike; we are all part of a broken humanity and prone to categorizing and typecasting others.

Friday night, responding to violence in Atlanta and elsewhere, Reverend Bernice King, daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., conveyed a similar message. “The end goal is we want change and we want it now…let’s stay focused [on nonviolence and peace] and remember: everybody is not on the same page. There are people who will try to incite a race war in this country. Let’s not fall into their hands and into their trap. There’s another way…Let’s not go back to business as usual. Let’s deal with these issues that people are crying out of their soul and their spirit…”

Berry has always emphasized an education of the whole person: head, heart and hands. When it comes to matters of race in America, we need just this sort of an education. We need to understand the societal structures and personal narratives that perpetuate racial injustice and insensitivity. We need to build bridges through generous actions and intentional friendships. And those of us in the white community need to listen receptively and respectfully to the heartache and rage of our African-American neighbors, if we hope for them to listen to some of the wounds and sorrows we carry.

In this way, we can learn how our words, actions, and attitudes must change. We can work to establish the kind of caring community that allows people of different backgrounds, interests and experiences to flourish side by side, regardless of race or ethnicity. We can make this one of our abiding institutional goals.

This past weekend, students and others here at Berry for the summer met outside the College Chapel, mindful of social distancing, to share their stories, express their anguish, and mourn our nation’s history of racial injustice. They plan to meet regularly this summer to create a safe place for those wanting to build bridges of understanding and deep friendship. Various student groups are working with professional staff to provide means for students, while away for the summer, to join this safe place virtually to grieve and consider these issues intently with others in the Berry community. Watch your email for more information.

It is fitting that this gathering occurred at the Chapel, for Berry has been shaped by values that are grounded in faith, values that emphasize a receptive mind, a generous heart, and hands willing to serve. As we look toward the fall semester and the prospects of a challenging election year, will you please join me in holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard as expressed in Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians (4:1-2): “To walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love.”

Dear Members of the Boston College Community:



The senseless death of George Floyd while in police custody has left millions in our country shaken, angry, and wondering how is it possible in our day that another black person in America could die in such circumstances. I share those feelings and questions, and I particularly ask how we at Boston College, members of an academic and faith community, can and should respond to the inhumane, racist behavior so evident last week in Minneapolis.



First, I invite you to join me in praying for George Floyd—whose brother described him as a God-fearing person and a man of peace—and for his family and all those who mourn his death. May God give them the strength and consolation they need at this time of devastating loss and sorrow.



In addition, we must condemn the racial prejudice and profound injustice leading to this latest shocking loss of a black person’s life in our country. Reflecting its Jesuit, Catholic heritage, Boston College insists that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect, and grace. It is essential that all of us review our lives to ensure that we act in accord with the Gospel mandate to love God and neighbor. Hatred and racism have no place anywhere, and we are called to challenge such behavior when manifested not only in our community but also in our nation and world.



Finally, it is essential that we remain people animated by faith, hope, and love and not let frustration, anger, and violence prevail. I believe especially helpful and appropriate for us today are words in the eighteenth chapter of the Gospel of St. Luke: “Pray and not lose heart.” And strengthened by our faith and bonds with one another, we must recommit ourselves to promoting a society where all have the possibility of life, liberty, and justice.

Dear Friends,

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to restore campus operations, our nation has been rocked by acts of violence and ensuing unrest and disruption that have now occurred here in Boston. We are confronted, once again, by the grim reality of systemic racism in our country. The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and others bring to the forefront these abhorrent elements in our society. At a time when we rely on our police more than ever, we watch painful examples of some officers breaking the public trust in the most egregious ways. These injustices are amplified by the vividly disparate impact of COVID-19 on African Americans in particular, as well as on other ethnic or minority communities.

We grieve for our country and those who are affected by systemic racism, just as we grieve for those afflicted by COVID-19. We will defeat COVID-19 using science and our collective will. We must commit the same will and energy to defeat systemic racism. We must reject the forces in our society that are driving us apart and commit ourselves to creating a just society.

In the current troubled climate, I believe our commitment to restoring our residential campus is made all the more important by the divisions in our country. We are working nonstop to restore campus operations for the fall and will shortly make more detailed announcements about this effort. This is critical because our residential community brings together students from every background to live and learn together, with our faculty, in an atmosphere that promotes mutual understanding and respect. And we are continually working to do this better for all members of the Boston University community. As I write you today, I recall the two months last spring when we witnessed the uniting effect on our community of the expanded Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground, before campus life was abruptly interrupted by the virus. Our return to our residential campus and our personal interactions with one another that are not mediated by a computer screen is essential to the critical work we must undertake to build a campus, a community, and a society that is free from systemic racism.

When we return to Commonwealth Avenue, life on campus will not look or be the same as it was last fall, but we can create a learning community that preserves Boston University as a beacon for the country and world. Such beacons are desperately needed in our country today. I look forward to welcoming you back to campus.

Dear Members of the Brandeis Community,

George Floyd’s killing was cruel, inhumane, and contemptible. The injustice of violence against black people must stop.

The history of our great university is intertwined with the pursuit of justice. Brandeis was created in response to antisemitism and bigotry. We cannot tolerate discrimination, hatred, or violence against another person based on their race, religion, or background. These values are as important today as they were at our founding.

These are not just words or noble ideas. These are principles that inspire us at Brandeis to educate, to learn, and to act.

With that in mind, I join with Mark Brimhall-Vargas, chief diversity officer, in calling for us to come together, even if virtually. In the message Mark sent on Friday, he mentioned two different events happening this week. The Heller School is hosting a conference, “Co-Constructing Racial Justice through Life and Work.” And Mark will host “Coming Together to Face Systemic Racism.” I hope you will join me in attending both.

As Brandeisians, not all of our experiences are shared ones. We come from different backgrounds and have different perspectives. But I know that there are some things we have in common. This includes an unwavering commitment to justice, equity, and inclusion. It includes respecting other people, no matter their background.

I hope to see you at one of the events tomorrow or the next day. Let us come together to express our commitment to ending racist violence.

Brown University,,7,7,https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-06-01/injustice,"Dear Brown Community, 

We write to you today as leaders of this university to express first deep sadness, but also anger, regarding the racist incidents that continue to cut short the lives of black people every day. 

The sadness comes from knowing that this is not a mere moment for our country. This is historical, lasting and persistent. Structures of power, deep-rooted histories of oppression, as well as prejudice, outright bigotry and hate, directly and personally affect the lives of millions of people in this nation every minute and every hour. Black people continue to live in fear for themselves, their children and their communities, at times in fear of the very systems and structures that are supposed to be in place to ensure safety and justice. 

The anger comes from knowing that we have been here before, and in fact have never left. Rallies and protests across the country are raising voices about ongoing injustice in the wake of the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, KY, and George Floyd in Minneapolis. As a nation, we might have thought there would be some real change after the deaths of Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland, both who died in police custody in 2015, a year in which some justice organizations reported more than 100 police shootings of unarmed black people in the United States. And this was after our nation mourned and protested the ongoing epidemic of racism with the 2014 deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and countless others before and after that year. 

All of these deaths “launched national conversations” about anti-black racism. And we know that so many in our community keep asking how many times these conversations have to happen before there is real change. We know there are so many in our community hurting and deeply frustrated, and things are made worse by a pandemic that doesn’t allow us to be together and is disproportionately killing black people. We have not been able to gather in some of the ways that usually unite us to build collective understanding, mourn and make calls for action. 

We hope that wherever you may be, you seek to effect change in your communities in the ways that make sense for you while preserving your health and safety in this time of COVID-19. And this does not apply only to members of our community residing in the United States. Tragic and traumatic examples of injustice against racial, ethnic and religious minorities persist around the world, resulting in horrific instances of brutality, incarceration and death. Our local and national government leaders need to hear from us as individual constituents in their communities consistently and persistently on issues of racial and ethnic injustice. 

As a university, we have tremendous resources in our departments, centers and institutes that can help our community and our society interrogate the persistent and deeply disturbing issues related to race, racism and police violence in America. In the weeks and months to come, we will leverage the expertise of our faculty, staff and students to develop programming, courses and research opportunities designed to advance knowledge and promote essential change in policy and practice in the name of equity and justice. 

We are a community that does not condone acts of racism, discrimination or violence. This cannot be accepted as “normal.” We must continue to demand equity and justice for all people, inclusive of all identities. And we must continue to care for and support each other, especially in this time when we are apart.

Butler University,,4,4,https://www.butler.edu/sites/default/files/message_presidentjamesmdanko.pdf,"Dear Butler Community Members,
The historic legacy of Butler University has its origins in its founding mission of 1855. Five years before the
outbreak of civil war that divided our nation over issues of slavery and succession, Ovid Butler and
community leaders established North Western Christian University, the forbearer of today’s Butler
University. Central to its unwavering sense of purpose was the fundamental belief that education should be
available to all—regardless of race, gender, or religion.
Today I would like to share thoughts on a broader set of issues confronting us. The global health crisis of the
past few months is now intersecting with a major national crisis: civil unrest sweeping across the nation
rooted in social injustice and economic disparity. The grief and anger being expressed in cities throughout
the country were sparked by the inexcusable killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. We must recognize that
the origins of this grief and anger run much deeper as structural racism has historically disadvantaged Black
Americans and people of color. Incidences of racial profiling have become an all-too-common occurrence.
While the pandemic is affecting universities in profound ways, higher education cannot abdicate its
responsibility to be leaders of dialogue about the many issues our nation is confronting. We are part of a
community of learners that values well-reasoned, evidence-based, compassionate dialogue. Let us not accept
all narratives. Let us work to find the common ground of truth that can lead us all to better solutions.
The health crisis and the end of the academic year have removed us from our personal interactions. But even
at a distance, we are still connected to each other as members of the Butler community. Let us be mindful of
those community members whose lives are personally affected by issues of racism, social injustice, and
economic disparity, especially our students who depend upon us to serve as educators and role models. Let
us also be sensitive to the many members of our community facing serious pandemic-related challenges—
whether physical, emotional, or financial.
Inherent in our founding mission, and reinforced by the contemporary “Butler Way,” is our shared moral
obligation to strive for a world in which the rights of all people are respected, and equal opportunities are
afforded, regardless of race, or whatever identities and backgrounds people represent.
It is my hope that everyone in the Butler community accepts leadership responsibility to reenergize and
reinforce the positive and fair-minded principles upon which this country was founded, and which were
further underscored by President Abraham Lincoln—that all individuals are created equal with the right
for “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” I am confident that such values were in the mind of Ovid
Butler when he founded our institution, and they remain ones to which we are collectively beholden today.

California Institute of Technology,,1,1,https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/campus-announcements/responding-death-george-floyd,"The brutal death of George Floyd in Minneapolis challenges our assumptions and our ideals. It casts into high relief tensions that are present in American society, but experienced very differently depending on your skin color. It cuts to the core of our aspirations as an academic community and reminds us of the work that we must do to attain them. 

Caltech's values demand a culture of inclusion where every individual is empowered to realize their full potential. We strive for a diverse community in every sense of the word because the discourse that results when people of different perspectives engage with each other is how we reach understanding and create knowledge. That discourse requires listening to and hearing with empathy what each individual has to say, informed by their particular life experience, and being prepared to have your mind changed. 

For many in the black community, Mr. Floyd's death and the events surrounding it have been felt especially acutely, in ways that most of us cannot fully understand because of the limits of our own experiences. As the Caltech community, we have to start here at home and make sure that the Institute is an inclusive environment that eschews stereotypes and recognizes every individual for their full worth.

As neighbors and as a community, we come together with a united message about the terrible and heartbreaking events that are traumatizing our state. Like many of you, we too are experiencing pain and anger, and together express our hope that we can stand together in our shared grief, anguish, and frustration.

This week, we witnessed another atrocious act of violence against a person of color in the police officer-involved killing of George Floyd. Our hearts go out to Mr. Floyd’s family and to the many others whose lives he touched. This incident in Minneapolis raises profound and troubling questions about police brutality, violence in our society, and institutionalized racism — issues that are critical for us to explore, teach about, research, study, discuss as a community, and address in our individual lives. 

We are always working to improve equity and inclusion on our two campuses and throughout our shared community, but this moment once again makes it clear that there is still so much more work to do.

Our strength is defined by how we treat and nurture each other. We are committed to making our community one that supports healing, advocates for meaningful action, and moves forward for a better future together.

Dear Members of the CMU Community, 

Even as our nation struggles to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to bear witness to the reality that systemic racism and injustice pervade our society. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery are but the latest examples of violent and dehumanizing acts of racism across the country. I am heartbroken and outraged by these tragedies, and I know that the CMU community around the world shares my concern for the victims’ families, and for those in our community who are most impacted by these hateful acts. Please know that we see you, we care about you and we are here for you. While I recognize I cannot fully understand the pain, anxiety and fear these events inflict on Black and African Americans, including many in our own community, I know that it is up to each one of us – no matter our background – to confront and dismantle racism and injustice wherever they exist. 

At times like this we must reflect on what we can do to make society, including our own community, more just. It would be inadequate to restate our commitment to respect, value, and foster diversity, equity and inclusion across our community. We know we have much work to do to live out these values at Carnegie Mellon. Learning about each other’s lived experiences; engaging with and supporting colleagues; challenging injustice when we witness it; and, especially, actively listening to each other will truly help us build the campus climate we seek. 

Uniting in the face of challenging times is the Carnegie Mellon way. Acts of solidarity at The Fence, community discussions and listening sessions have helped us all grieve and heal together. Although we cannot gather in traditional ways, we will be working in the days and weeks ahead to curate virtual opportunities to consider actions we as a community can take to be the change we wish to see in the world. In the meantime, we ask our entire community to come together, with humility, compassion and empathy, to support one another, including those who are feeling especially vulnerable now.

Carthage College,,3,3,https://twitter.com/carthagecollege/status/1267552874898259968,"Dear Carthage Students, Faculty, and Staff,

The very first words of Carthage’s mission statement call us to seek truth. The very last minutes of George Floyd’s life tell a truth that is both tragic and important. That truth is of a man immobilized in police custody, pleading to be able to breathe, calling for his mother, dying under a police officer’s knee. That truth is that the encounter lasted minutes, not seconds, ample time for that police officer to change his mind. The truth is that during these minutes, there were other police officers who could have intervened, but did not, and that there were bystanders speaking to the police, pleading for George Floyd’s life. In those moments, for all to see, there was neither justice nor mercy. I grew up in the South, and the video reminds me of footage during the civil rights movement, when police in Birmingham, Alabama, turned hoses and dogs on people who protested nonviolently against desegregation. In that footage there is a similar truth, of violence by police against defenseless citizens. And there is another similar truth: the ugly truth of racism. We are no strangers to racism at Carthage. We are not afraid to tell the truth of racism, to condemn it, to discuss its history, and to seek its end. All those who attended our series this year, America: A Racial History, gained a deeper understanding of its forms and consequences. We know that only through education and vigilance can humanity work against it. We know that education about racism is our obligation as an educational community. And we know that our work is not done, for we must always do more.

Students, faculty, and staff, know that Carthage stands for the welcome and belonging of all in our community. As a proudly Lutheran Institution we are both rooted and open. Know that Carthage recognizes inclusion as one of the most important ways in which we build both the strength of our community and the strength of each other. Know, finally, the words of Scripture: “What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” (Micah 6:8)

Case Western Reserve University,,3,3,https://business.facebook.com/casewesternreserve/posts/10158494854383086?__tn__=K-R,"President Snyder and Provost Vinson issued a statement last night about local protests following the death of George Floyd:

Six years later, the words are the same.

I can’t breathe.

After all of the mourning and protests, the lawsuits and training, the promises made and lessons learned, nothing, it seems, has changed.

Lying on a Staten Island sidewalk in the summer of 2014, Eric Garner said “I can’t breathe” nearly a dozen times as a police officer’s arm stayed tight around his throat.

Last Monday in Minneapolis, George Floyd repeated the same phrase—in his case, with an officer’s knee pressing into his neck.

The local protests that followed have spread across the country, reaching Cleveland on Saturday. Ours opened peacefully, but devolved soon after marchers reached the Justice Center a few blocks away. Protesters pitched water bottles and spray-painted walls, officers released tear gas canisters, and before long, police cars were engulfed in flames.

Today protests continued in communities nationwide—and even extended to London and Berlin. In Cleveland, meanwhile, officials announced a noon curfew for downtown to allow time for clean-up of streets and stores.

But what about the systemic racism cited so often in recent days? How can a city, a country, “clean up” that?

We cannot—should not—ever try to wipe away the past.

We need to know it. Own it. And commit to forging a better future.

Four months after Eric Garner died in 2014, Tamir Rice was shot and killed by police while playing with a toy gun outside a Cleveland recreation center.

He was 12 years old.

The following year, the city accepted a 110-page settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The document required sweeping reforms to address the department’s record of excessive force and urgent need to restore community trust.

The monitoring team’s most recent report, issued in September, found force incidents fell by nearly a third compared to 2017.

That team, including deputy monitor Ayesha Bell Hardaway of our law school, still found shortcomings, in particular in terms of resources for training and data systems. Nevertheless, the group concluded the department had made “substantial progress.”

While the medical examiner ruled Garner’s death a homicide, the officer who choked him never faced charges. Nor did the one who killed Tamir. On Friday, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder. He appears in court tomorrow.

Small steps, true. But in a moment of so much anger… and pain… and sorrow, they matter.

In the often-quoted words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. “…the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

As an institution of higher learning, we have a profound responsibility to the future. When it comes to this moment, how can we best begin to fulfill it?

This week, we will provide opportunities to engage, and share resources for those who would like support. Tonight, though, we want to remind you of a part of our legacy: The first Commencement address Frederick Douglass ever gave came at Western Reserve College in 1854.

“The relation subsisting between the white and black people of this country is the vital question of the age,” he told some 3,000 in attendance. “In the solution of this question, the scholars of America will have to take an important… part.”

Kansas State,,4,5,https://www.k-state.edu/today/info/announcement/?id=65557,"Dear K-State Family,

As we work to reawaken our university community from our COVID-19 isolation, we also must contend with social injustice issues plaguing our country. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, around the country, we witnessed acts of prejudice toward those from China and other Asian countries. Now, we are witnessing protests over the killing of black and Latino individuals by law enforcement officers. This is clearly no time to be silent on issues of social justice.

A number of K-State faculty and staff have meaningfully engaged the Kansas higher education community in dialogue on these matters. We believe, unapologetically, that there is nothing to debate. Social injustice is alive and well and more often than not, finds its way to the doorsteps and lives of individuals in the most marginalized communities.

We recognize these acts of injustice may not have taken place on our campuses or in our communities, but they can still have a profound impact on our community members. Our students, faculty, staff and administrators are affected by these acts of injustice. In some cases, members of our community may think this could happen to them, their family members or their friends.

The Kansas State University Police Department is dedicated to our community and strives to earn our confidence and respect. We know this respect is hard-won and can be easily lost — it only takes one incident to erase years of goodwill. Our officers are highly professional and well trained in how to interact with our community members. We have confidence they endeavor to uphold our community values. In this time of strife, they also deserve our continued respect and support. 

At Kansas State University, we affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain an atmosphere of justice based on respect for each other. We understand the impact these acts of social injustice have on marginalized communities and their allies. We stand with you and we ask our community members to demonstrate the empathy, sympathy and social responsibility that reflects the same accountability we expect of those entrusted to protect and serve.

Those who have been impacted by recent events are encouraged to contact Student Life or Counseling Services by calling 785-532-6927.

Social injustice has always been with us, but we must stand up for what's right and support those who feel threatened or marginalized.

Our hearts ache for both the nation we have worked to make more just and equitable and for the city we love and call home. Through our grief for the countless known and unknown victims of systematic racism, we continue to pray that we can use this moment to shine light in our communities. This is not the moment to fall into despair. The world needs our leadership and love. As our forefathers and mothers from the Atlanta Student Movement, the larger Civil Rights Movement, and every struggle for justice in America have shown us, we accomplish great things when we act in solidarity with those who fight for freedom and push America to live up to its promise.

For well over a century, the institutions of the Atlanta University Center have worked to use the light of knowledge to guide the nation out of dark times. The very existence of Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Spelman College is a form of protest in itself—a recognition that education can illuminate the path to justice and equality and a demand that it be available to the sons and daughters of the diaspora. While we are proud of the leaders in every field our institutions have sent forth into the workforce, we are even prouder of their preparation to carry forward the hard work of making the world better through ideas, innovation, creativity, courage, and determination.

What can we do, individually and as the AUC community? What is the way forward? What are the difficult conversations we need to have and with whom? What are the action plans we need to craft? These are the challenges in the days and weeks ahead. Together, we must continue to thoughtfully engage in the hard work of creating positive change in our communities and across our nation.

Let there be no doubt: Racism, injustice, violence, brutality and hatred, in any form, cannot be tolerated. 

Amid the turbulent times of 2020, we find our Clemson family physically apart due to COVID-19. Still, we can and should reach out to those in our family who are hurting or in need.

We seek to understand one another’s challenges, and are tolerant and forgiving. And, we come from diverse backgrounds that make up one inclusive Clemson Family. 

Our work is not only in the moment, but it also lies in the daily development of our University community, as we work to ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued as a part of this Clemson Family. 

As we continue to prepare our campus for the return of our full community this fall, we must keep working to repair the world every day, step by step, to make Clemson and our world a better place for us all.

Colgate University,,5,5,https://www.colgate.edu/about/offices-centers-institutes/office-communications/university-correspondence/message-0,"Dear Colgate University Community,

On March 12, with safety and wellbeing at the forefront of our thoughts, we asked students to return home for the remainder of the semester. The days and weeks since then have been unlike anything we have witnessed in our lifetime. This week, the country reached the terrible milestone of 100,000 deaths as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we now see more than 40 million Americans out of work. 

The pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color due to inequities in healthcare and their overrepresentation as essential workers. While communities of color continue to mourn their loved ones and serve as essential workers, the nation experienced the additional horror of watching the killing of George Floyd. The anger, fear, and pain came on the heels of the very recent killings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. These acts of racism and injustice are all too familiar and unacceptable. 

Every year, Colgate celebrates Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy. He is remembered as a minister at the helm of a movement against segregation and racism. Today, on the anniversary of the Tulsa Race Riots, as we watch protests continue in cities across the country, I am reminded of his speech titled “Other America,” in which King said, “Certain conditions continue to exist in our society, which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard …. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.” Even as we condemn additional acts of violence, we must also know that we are witnessing the manifestation of Dr. King’s words today, as many of us witnessed in 2014 after Michael Brown was killed, in 1992 after Rodney King was attacked, countless times during the Civil Rights era, and in 1921 in Tulsa.

Colgate’s mission has always been to educate reasoned and reasonable leaders, citizens of the world, who change that world through intelligence, empathy, and grace. This remains our mission. We must vow to do better to address and dismantle racism and systemic inequality on our own campus and in this world. This is challenging and uncomfortable work but it is essential, and the brunt of it should not rest on the shoulders of our black and brown faculty, staff, or students. We must stand together for a more just society. 

Colleges and universities, typically and rightfully, refrain from speaking about matters of the day. They are not political entities. They must allow for a space for debate and disagreement about politics and affairs of the world. But we are all part of a shocked and angry nation. This is truly one of those rare times when the institution must break from its silence on world events, for this is also a moment when silence is a form of complicity, not merely a turning of a blind eye, but a participation in the injustice we have, again, seen.

I ask that you take care of each other, and continue to keep this nation in your prayers.

Sincerely,

College of Charleston,,1,1,https://emergency.cofc.edu/campus-update-following-charleston-protests-may-31-2020/,"Dear Campus Community, 

As you know, numerous protests continued to take place around the country on Saturday and into the early morning hours today in response to the recent death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 

Unfortunately, a number of peaceful protests, including one in downtown Charleston, turned violent, with some committing acts of vandalism, such as breaking windows, setting fires and attempting to loot local businesses. In addition to damage to numerous properties along and around King Street, some windows and doors were broken on several of our campus buildings, including portions of the Warren Place Residence Halls (which were not unoccupied at the time), the College of Charleston Bookstore on Calhoun Street and the College Corner store on King Street. 

I want to thank our Public Safety officers and Facilities Management crews who worked through the night to safeguard our campus, to secure properties and to make emergency repairs. College leaders remain in close contact with City of Charleston and police officials to coordinate law enforcement efforts. Although summer classes are currently taking place online, there are a few students and employees who remain on campus. Public Safety officers have increased patrols and will maintain a visible presence on and around campus. All campus emergencies should be reported by calling 911. Non-emergencies can be reported by calling 843.953.5609. 

As assessment and repair of campus properties continues and as we monitor the situation throughout the day, any decisions impacting work schedules for Monday and beyond will be announced to campus ahead of time. As we remain in Phase 1 of our return-to-work-on-campus plan, most campus employees will continue to work remotely. 

Students who wish to talk virtually with a counselor today can reach a counselor through our Public Safety office at 843.953.5609. If you have other safety concerns, either for yourself or for others, please use the FAST (Faculty/Staff Assisting Students in Trouble) Form. A member of our student care team will follow up as quickly as possible. 

As a campus community, we strongly denounce the acts that led to George Floyd’s death, and we also do not condone violence or criminal acts in response. As a university, we believe in Americans’ rights to free speech and peaceful assembly and will uphold and defend these rights for any members of our community. But no matter how upset and angry we may be about the injustices taking place in our country, we implore our community to remain calm, to comply with all laws and to refrain from engaging in destruction of property and violence toward others. 

Sincerely,

At William & Mary, one important role is continually to call ourselves to awareness of our history, in the present. As the great American writer James Baldwin taught us, “not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” 

None of us can ignore the turmoil, the heartbreak, of the racial divisions in our country — a cascade of grief for Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd has brought it to the fore. The racism and injustice we continue to witness bring grievous hurt to our communities. It comes to us at a moment when so many in this nation and the world are vulnerable, intensifying the loss and weariness of pandemic. We are facing again the legacy of our country’s founding, that did not recognize the full humanity of all peoples. African Americans in our communities are asking, in this moment, do you recognize my full humanity? We do. We will face this with you. 

A critical role of a university at moments of crisis is to rededicate ourselves to the propositions that sustain a pluralistic democracy. We recognize that we are still far from realizing them for all: fairness, respect for the human dignity of others, evidence-based argument, scientific discovery, the pursuit of opportunity and safety and equal justice under the law. 

As a public university in Virginia, dedicated to the perpetuity of democratic institutions, it has never been more important that we commit ourselves to change that advances these values. We must find it within ourselves to look for hope. And as we face unspeakable acts, we must be there to help lift one another’s heavy hearts — so we can study together, learn and work together, toward a more humane and free world. The past week’s events demonstrate how much farther we have to go. 

As we search for paths forward during these uncertain times, the role of a university provides some clarity and William & Mary’s core values of belonging, respect and integrity provide direction. The diverse communities and perspectives we convene — to grapple with our imperfections and our legacies of inequality — are our best hope for empowering those who study here to build our future together.

Columbia University,,3,3,https://president.columbia.edu/news/message-president-lee-c-bollinger,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I am writing in both a personal and an institutional capacity. Like everyone, I have been reflecting on the events of the last week with an increasing sense of anguish at the human suffering we are witnessing and of alarm at the national crisis we are facing in our political system.

Until last Friday, I did not think it was possible for me to forget even for a moment that we are in the midst of an historic pandemic, bringing untold human loss and crossing a numerical threshold of unimaginable proportions. But the horrifying ending of the life of George Floyd, a citizen in the very system of justice intended to protect him, and us, which then, along with other recent tragic deaths, drew back the curtains on centuries of invidious discrimination against African Americans, and others, did that. My hopes for a renewed sense of national purpose to continue the heroic efforts of so many, over so many generations, to change once and for all that terrible course of history have been raised, and then deflated. We are at a point in our history where political leadership is not only absent but also disturbingly confounding of the fundamental norms and values that take years and years of hard and determined work to develop—and yet are always so fragile when pitted against the worst instincts of human nature. My concerns here are not partisan, but basic to our culture.

Like so many others here, I have chosen to dedicate my life to sustaining and building academic institutions, and my beloved Columbia, specifically. There is no question that the expectations of intellectual character we choose to live by in the academic world are extreme, and we cannot reasonably expect them to set the bar for ordinary political deliberations and interactions. But what we are seeing today—which unfortunately included just in the last week an unfounded attack on our research and researchers, as well as on the University itself—is at the opposite end of the spectrum. If this were a single incident, that would be one thing, but in the current way of behaving, these become acts of intimidation and dangerous mischaracterization of expertise, one of the hallmarks of a descent into authoritarianism.

In the face of all this, it is only a start to express empathy and solidarity with those in our community who are experiencing loss and apprehension. But I certainly do so here, on behalf of all of us. Universities are not perfect and we have to accept our share of responsibility for the state of affairs we have today. But we are determined, even more so now, to change and to be better. More than anything we will continue to provide the society and the world with all the knowledge we can preserve and create and with a new generation of citizens and leaders who are prepared to live by, and fight for, the values of respect for reason, the love of ideas, and the wish to use these to care for others.

Cornell University,,5,5,https://statements.cornell.edu/2020/20200529-oq5bv7-recent-killings.cfm,"Dear Cornellians, 

I am heartbroken, angry and frankly sickened by the recent killing of George Floyd, and before him, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and others whose deaths are less well publicized. 

The amount of pain in the Black community is unfathomable, especially as these are occurring in the midst of a pandemic that is having such a disproportionate impact on communities of color. 

Decent people and institutions cannot stand silent while such violence against our fellow citizens continues. 

I want to make clear, both personally and on behalf of Cornell, that we will do all we can as a university to address this scourge of racism. We will address it directly in our educational programs, in our research and in our engagement and related activities, working through the ways we know best to push for a world that is equitable and kind; where people do not have to fear for their lives because of the color of their skin; and where everyone has the same opportunities to grow, thrive and enjoy their lives. 

My heart goes out to everyone who is feeling the pain of these recent incidents. 

Sincerely, 

Martha",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,
Covenant College,,7,7,https://www.covenant.edu/news/06.02.20,"Dear Covenant College Community,

I know in recent days all of us have been heavy with grief and lament, perhaps feeling much like the prophet, Job: ""For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water. For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me. I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."" (Job 3:24-26)

As we transitioned to remote education this spring and then watched as our world was gripped by a pandemic and the onset of an economic recession, it was hard to imagine that life could become more challenging. Then, just a week ago, we were witnesses to the brutal killing of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white police officer. That unjust taking of the life of a man bearing the image of God, when piled on top of the senseless killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, snapped something in the psyche of our nation.

For African-Americans, these deaths reopened old wounds—wounds that are the product of slavery and Jim Crow and the sacrificial strivings of the Civil Rights Movement. We lament the sin that has wrought such devastating effects on the black community in the form of racial injustice and structural biases. We mourn with our brothers and sisters who are reminded of marginalization and oppression that is still, and has been for too long, a part of their experience.

Events like those we’ve witnessed in recent weeks ought to provoke serious reflection, heartfelt repentance, and deep compassion. While those of us in the majority culture may want to somehow fix things quickly, we can and should stop now to listen to our African-American brothers and sisters. Doing so can be—it almost surely will be—uncomfortable and unsettling. But, it’s a part of our calling as fellow image-bearers. Their pain is our pain. Their suffering is our suffering.

We also must give ourselves to prayer: prayers of lament for the sin that mars our lives and our world; prayers of repentance for the ways in which we’ve sinned against our fellow-image bearers; prayers for justice in our land; prayers for healing and reconciliation; prayers for God’s mercy on us all and for the renewing work of his gospel in our lives. We know that we are wrestling not just against “flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places” (Eph. 6:12).

In support of this end, I would like to invite all of you to join me in prayer Monday, June 8 at 11:00am. For those of you who are on campus or local, I would invite you to meet in the chapel to pray. (We’ll need to observe social distancing and—if we can’t—wear masks, but in a time when human bodies have been the site of violence, it will be good for us to be together in body.) If you aren’t able to be in the chapel on Monday—I know that’s the case for most of you—I would still ask you to stop and pray at 11:00am. And I would ask you to pray for these things:
Justice in the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor
Reform in the aspects of policing and the criminal justice system that have been disfigured by sin
Racial reconciliation across our country
God’s comfort, both for those in our community and for those outside of it, who are suffering because of these events
Open ears, minds, and hearts—for us here at Covenant College and for believers everywhere—to listen to those who are angry or in pain
Wisdom to know how we might best serve God’s reconciling work in this world, in our community here at the college first and then through the lives of our graduates as they go out into the world
Praying isn’t all we will do, but it is perhaps the best and most important thing we can do right now. The pain is real and deep. There is reason to lament and repent. We need the Holy Spirit to work among us, to work in the Church, and to work in our land.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

In Christ,

Creighton University,,5,5,https://www.creighton.edu/office-president/messages-campus/spring-2020/may-31-2020,"As the Christian community around the world celebrates Pentecost, or the Holy Spirit, today, I am mindful of different images and symbols from Scripture and elsewhere that try to convey something of this mystic expression of God present among us. Fire, wind, and doves a-flight convey the work of inspiration, wisdom, courage, grace, and so on, common effects around us or within that represent God’s influence and the manifestation of remarkable human capacities and responses. 

In these days in particular, however, I am deeply struck with the analogy of the Holy Spirit as breath which fills and fuels our lives. From Genesis to Job to John, in Judeo-Christian verse, God’s breath – the spirit of God – gives life, and yet what we have actually seen this week is just the opposite, breath violently pressed and taken from the life of an individual, George Floyd. Almost instantly, his plea, “I can’t breathe,” has reverberated from one community to the next as cities, and a nation, chant that same desperate reality. As Mr. Floyd’s cry resounds in shouts anew, it is also a haunting echo of both recent other African American individuals – Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and others who lost their lives due to insidious racism – and those of generations and centuries of people of color in our entire American history also crying out for the fullness of life.

At Creighton University, where, as an institution of higher learning, we offer a wide range of programs across the social sciences, health care, law, and business, we also study and teach the humanities, and the questions of philosophy, theology, art, language, literature, and history ask our students about the meanings of their lives, and about the meanings of lives of those around them. We push them deeply into themselves, and we pull them into other cultures, customs, perspectives, and experiences. Our mission and identity as Jesuit and Catholic compels such a commitment, including providing the practices of religious faith and facilitating service to others. What and how we study, in how we recognize and wrestle with God, and in seeking to make the world better – each of these influences and even more edge us each day into and around the essential issues of truth, justice, and human dignity, and the imbibing values of diversity and inclusivity.

There is no denying that George Floyd’s killing is a serious scandal in itself, but it also represents that individual and systemic prejudices, inequalities, and deprivations in the lives of black Americans historically and daily, communally and individually, and nationally and locally, cannot be denied. And as Creighton, that is, as Jesuit and Catholic, and as committed to higher learning, and as determined to make the world better, we must do more.

On the eve of Pentecost, I spoke yesterday with our alumni community from St. John’s Church in the heart of our Creighton campus, naming the national context of racism and discrimination. I also talked about the global reality of the novel coronavirus pandemic in our lives, recognizing a deadly force that demands health care expertise, equipment, research, patience, compassion, and so much more, and here again, in Pentecost, I am cognizant of yet another force that truly robs us of breath. While we all know that COVID-19 is indeed indiscriminate, we also know that social determinants, wealth gaps, and systemic realities portend disproportionate results, and that people of color are in fact more susceptible.

The unfairness, discrimination, and violence of racism in our nation, and the sickness, economic duress, and stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic are real. For the death that occurs in both, including the loss of life that happened here in Omaha during unrest last night, I share the sadness, confusion, concern, and pain of so many, particularly the members of the Creighton community locally, nationally, and globally. I am also aware that thoughts, feelings, and experiences impact us differently, and in this I am especially mindful of people of color whose own American context is framed and informed by other realities of which I cannot represent. But we believe that the power of the Holy Spirit reconciles and breathes new life. We must recognize the complexities and complicities that contribute to the smothering effects of these great ills of racism and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the opportunities and actions for an institution of higher learning to create healing and wholeness. The Spirit calls Creighton to do more.

As we begin the last week of classes, we are preparing to send our newest graduates into the world and celebrate their accomplishments and their promise. 

At the same time, we recognize the sobering realities of the world that they are poised to enter. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens the health of our communities and has sent our economy reeling. The unrelenting march of climate change threatens the lives we lead, with particular impact on the most vulnerable among us. And we are exhausted by partisan efforts to limit equity, diversity, and inclusion on our campus and within our society more broadly. As daunting as these and other issues may be, they are ones that we can work together to resolve. 

Which brings me to what may be the most consequential issue facing our world today. The forces that seek to divide us, the voices that sow bigotry and hate, are strong and loud at this moment. Racism continues to be a stain on our nation. We are outraged by deplorable acts of violence against black men and women, such as the recent killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. And by the less visible structural forms of racism that lead people of color to disproportionately shoulder the burdens of poverty and inequality as has been so strikingly evident in the higher incidence of illness, job loss, and death they are experiencing as a result of the pandemic. 

At times, what we face can seem overwhelming. But there is much about our work at Dartmouth that gives me hope. First and foremost, our collective resolve that racism, bigotry, and hate have no place on our campus or in our society. 

We are resolute and united in this belief. Second, I am heartened by the impact that Dartmouth alumni--and our students who will soon join their ranks--are having in bettering the world using their keen intellects and the values honed over their years at Dartmouth. And finally, I am lifted by knowing that our faculty and staff every day advance the frontiers of knowledge as they take on these great issues of our time for the collective good. 

As we look forward to the conferring of degrees on June 14, let us not despair at the challenges our newest graduates will face. Instead, let us redouble our efforts to build a world that is equitable, diverse, and inclusive, free from racism, bigotry, and hate. Let us give voice to the values that unite us rather than divide us. No threat is too grave if we face it together.

His death echoes with the pain of other lives lost senselessly, most recently among them Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery and Sean Reed.

As leaders of an institution that values diversity and inclusion as central to its mission, we are galvanized in our anti-racist, anti-bias, anti-hate efforts and our pledge to embrace inclusion, equity and justice. 

This moment in history, marked by the inhumanity demonstrated by some, will not define all of us. We have witnessed heartfelt care and concern for each other as COVID-19 shut down our campus and the country, and that gives us hope, especially as we continue to educate the future leaders in whom we see such promise. 

As we experience grief and outrage, we must think about our individual and collective responsibility to create a more just society today and tomorrow. We absolutely reject the hatred and bigotry we continue to see in this nation. Each year, DePauw holds its Day of Dialogue to address bias, hate and inequity, and we -- along with President-elect White -- intend to do so again this year, in addition to hosting, facilitating and participating in other events and efforts inclusive of all staff, faculty and students. Once our new president arrives in July, we intend to call our DePauw community together to discuss concrete ways we can use our teaching, scholarship, community outreach and other resources to be active participants in the work needed to address historic injustice in our society.

In the meantime, all across the country, we are witnessing demonstrations rightfully demanding an end to injustice, racism and police brutality. Each of us must decide how we respond, and we urge you to do so peacefully and compassionately, for the safety of yourselves and others. 

Please know that services and resources remain available for DePauw students, staff and faculty, including Counseling Services; Spiritual Life; and the Center for Diversity and Inclusion. 

Many in our DePauw community are justifiably fearful that they, or their family, friends and loved ones, could be the target of violence based solely on their identity. This fear is magnified by the anxiety we all already share about the health of our communities amid the continuing pandemic. Sharing the weight of that pain and fear through empathy, understanding and compassion, even if you are not among those most affected, is needed more urgently than ever. 

Until we see all of you again, safely returned to our campus, our hearts are with you.

Drake University,,3,3,https://news.drake.edu/2020/06/01/standing-for-justice/,"Dear colleagues and students,

George Floyd died one week ago today, handcuffed and pinned to the ground by Officer Derek Chauvin of the Minneapolis Police Department. The video of the arrest shows Officer Chauvin with his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck while Mr. Floyd pleads with the officer, telling him that he is in pain and that he cannot breathe, before he calls out for his mother. Officer Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than two minutes after Mr. Floyd became non-responsive.

Mr. Floyd was pronounced dead at the Hennepin County Medical Center a little over an hour after he was first approached by Minneapolis police officers. He was forty-six years old. He was a son, a brother, a friend, the father of two daughters, and a grandfather to a three-year-old girl. He died telling Officer Chauvin, “I can’t breathe.” He died saying to Officer Chauvin, “please, please, please.” He died calling out to his deceased mother.

Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and he and the three other Minneapolis police officers involved in Mr. Floyd’s death have been fired. While it is commendable that these actions have been taken, it remains heartbreaking and infuriating that Mr. Floyd’s pleas were met with such callous disregard by Officer Chauvin and his fellow officers. This is made all the more heartbreaking and infuriating by the fact that Mr. Floyd is not the first Black man to die while telling a police officer, “I can’t breathe.”

We can and we must do better. This is required of every single one of us and every single institution in this country. Justice demands that we all do our part to confront and overcome the legacy of bigotry that motivates an Officer Chauvin to put his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck and keep it there as Mr. Floyd’s life is extinguished.

This institution and its people—faculty, staff, students, and alumni—have worked and will continue to work to stamp out bigotry and intolerance, to make our campus and our communities welcoming and safe for all. Indeed, we demonstrated our willingness to be in this fight together nearly two years ago with the Paint It Black movement. Drake University is committed to equity and inclusion and we will—through education, scholarship, service, and advocacy—strive to be part of whatever it takes to ensure that the right to life and liberty is not denied to anyone because of the color of her or his skin.

Over the past few weeks, many of us have watched in horror the widely circulated videos of separate incidents leading to the deaths of two African American men, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. These tragedies have devastated the African American community and should be deeply impactful for each and every one of us. These video images defy explanation and we at Drexel share in the nation’s sense of mourning and deep concern.

These two events are the most recent examples of brutality of this nature and cause me to believe even more strongly in our collective efforts to build an inclusive environment that recognizes and respects people of all backgrounds and experiences. I remain committed to this and encourage you to do your part to eliminate racism in our university and our country. As a part of this commitment, Kim Gholston, Drexel’s Chief Diversity Officer, will facilitate a virtual dialogue about race for members of the Drexel community. In this way, we hope to provide a space for dialogue that acknowledges the deep-rooted history of marginalization and pain in the African American community and explore how we can be active allies. Information on joining the dialogue will be shared as soon as the event is scheduled.

The University also encourages anyone who has been affected by or witnessed discrimination, harassment or bias, including graffiti, to immediately report the incident to OED by calling 215.895.1405 or emailing oed@drexel.edu at any time. For emergencies or after-hours reports, the University encourages all individuals to contact the Drexel University Police Department at 215.895.2222. DUPD will share these reports with OED.

Please know that students in need of individual support in processing these currents can contact the Office of Counseling and Health Services. Faculty and professional staff can contact the Employee Assistance Program.

I believe that Drexel can influence the lives of our community for the better. We are committed to ensuring that Drexel University is a campus environment where all people — students, faculty, professional staff and guests — feel welcome and safe to be themselves.

This week, as the United States passed the grim milestone of 100,000 lives lost to the coronavirus, the horrifying death of George Floyd has drawn national attention to fundamental and systematic disparities of justice in our nation. The events in Minneapolis have occurred on the heels of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, the shooting of Breonna Taylor and in the context of the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on communities of color, including here in Durham. For many people at Duke and elsewhere, the pain, trauma and sense of hopelessness is overwhelming.

Every day, throughout our country, African American and other marginalized communities have their safety and dignity threatened—in their places of work, in public spaces, and in their homes and neighborhoods. This ongoing history of structural and sustained racism is a fundamental and deeply distressing injustice, here as elsewhere.

But we as a university must do more than recognize and grieve these circumstances; we must work together to change them. In our Duke statement of values, we affirm our commitment to trust, respect, and inclusion. In that spirit, Duke University will continue the work of addressing generations of racism and injustice, of seeking ways to approach one another with respect, and of building communities that are truly safe, supportive, and inclusive for all.

My very best wishes to the entire Duke family in this troubling time.

With a heavy heart, I write today about the events we are witnessing across America and the truth of the continued experience of our Black friends and colleagues. While my full understanding of what this feels like for the members of our Black community is limited, I share in grief, anger and sorrow with you. Please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.

I am writing this morning to the majority of the Elon community that is White. The pictures and the messages we are seeing and reading are not new, in fact we have been in this moment before. As educators, we deeply believe that education is vital to creating opportunity for all. Unfortunately, the repeated racism that Black members of our community face is proof that the systems we have built are not yet adequate. We have substantial work to be done and that will require the collective efforts of all of us.

When I was in college in the early 1980s, universities had just begun bystander training. One of the practices taught was to identify a bystander in the crowd, make eye contact and ask for help. “You in the green shirt, please help me!” Research has shown that moment can move a bystander to action. During a phone call yesterday with a college friend, she reminded me of that training.

We are all wearing green shirts today. Harness the emotions you are feeling and join me in committing to renew and expand our efforts. We know we can’t keep doing the same thing and expect a different result. We must seek new solutions, new understanding, and open ourselves up to what we don’t know and what we don’t understand. Our Black colleagues need us to insist on change now.

Naturally our next question is, “How?” Here are two things I ask you to commit to doing. First, reach out to your Black friends and colleagues and check in. Let them know you care and appreciate them and wish for them the fullness of an equitable life. Let them know you will personally commit to antiracist work here at Elon and in the broader world. And then, check-in with your White friends, colleagues, and family and ask them to join you in making the same commitment to take action against racism.

Second, join the community in reading and discussing this fall’s common reading selection, Jennifer Eberhardt’s Biased: Uncovering the Hidden Prejudice That Shapes What We See, Think, and Do. Dr. Eberhardt challenges us to recognize how perceptions of race shape our every interaction and then do something about it. Her book and her message could not be more timely for the work ahead.

In the coming weeks, I personally commit to deepening my efforts, seeking new knowledge through reading and research to aid in more fully understanding the experience of the Black community and reviewing our university policies and practices. Members of the university’s senior staff join me in that effort and I ask that each of you do the same so that we can ensure that the privileges we enjoy are truly and fully available to all.

The death of George Floyd laid bare the urgent need for our nation to address social injustice more effectively. Each of us can make a difference as we pursue individual responsibility for promoting values of social justice, equality, and peace. As we individually chart the course of our thinking and positive actions, we will then collectively as a community work together to be a beacon of social justice and promoters of peace and understanding.

Florida Southern College is a community that embraces the tenets of social justice, inclusivity, respect for all persons, civility, and peaceful interactions. This is clearly stated in our Cornerstone. The values shared in our Cornerstone are not just words, but rather they are treasured values that are infused into the rhythm of our hearts.

I pray for our campus community daily, and I invite you to join me in prayers for peace, understanding, and positive change to abound in our nation. I hope you will take some comfort and inspiration from the words from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. more than 50 years ago: “Let us remember that there is a creative force in this universe, working to pull down the gigantic mountains of evil, a power that is able to make a way out of no way, and transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. Let us realize that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

Fordham University,,4,4,https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/a-message-from-father-mcshane-statement-on-the-death-of-george-floyd/,"Dear Members of the Fordham Family,

It is with a heavy and (let me be honest here) angry heart that I write to you today. I suspect that your hearts are also angry and heavy with sorrow. And how could we not be angry, dismayed and sorrowful at this moment? In the course of the past few painful months, we have witnessed the savage and senseless killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, as well as many other instances of violence—lethal and not—against people of color in the United States. That is not to mention the longstanding economic violence against people of color and their communities in this country, and the widespread, systemic and shameful disregard for the value of their lives in the eyes of others. (We have seen this systemic disregard quite clearly during the COVID-19 pandemic: amid the suffering across the country, and especially in the Bronx, communities of color were and are more vulnerable and more harshly affected than are white communities.)

I do not think I have to convince any of you that these acts and this state of affairs are sinful and immoral, and that they go against everything that a Jesuit university stands for. I do, however, think that some of our fellow citizens need to be reminded that they are happening every day in our very midst—in our own communities. Although we don’t all like to admit it, people of color—and let’s be frank, especially Black people—live lives of relentlessly hostile scrutiny, and they have been telling us so since the ink on the Thirteenth Amendment was barely dry. Four years ago, when we were confronted with a sadly similar shameful moment, former President Obama wrote that, “When incidents like this occur, there’s a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their ?skin, they are not being treated the same. And that hurts. And that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue. It’s not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about. All fair-minded people should be concerned.” And he was and is right. The problems that we must confront belong to all of us. Therefore, we need to own up to them. We have to own them. All of us. Their solutions also need to be owned by everyone, but especially by our leaders and those in positions of authority and influence.

Yesterday, in the immediate aftermath of George Floyd’s death former President Obama once again issued a statement that said, in part, “…we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal’ — whether it’s while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park.”

As you might imagine, I found myself returning to President Obama’s haunting reflections over and over again in the course of the past few days. And I was made uneasy by them—in the best possible sense of that word. For you see, I heard in them the unmistakable ring of truth. And that truth pierced me to the heart. Therefore, I asked myself how the Fordham family can and should respond to the challenges that the events of past week have presented to us. Of course, as a community of faith, we will pray for the repose of the souls of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. We will also pray for their families as they wrestle with the losses they have suffered in and through the deaths of those whom they loved so dearly. That goes without saying, and I ask you to join me in those fervent prayers.

But, let’s be honest. That is not enough. We must do more. We are a university community. Therefore, we must also recommit ourselves to the work that is proper to us as an academic community. A university’s greatest strength is its intellectual capital—the research, teaching, and learning that occurs both in and outside of the classroom. It is our central mission, and the one on which we expend the great majority of our budget and most of our energy—intellectual and moral. Tapping into these strengths and assets, we must recommit ourselves to the work of educating for justice and to doing all we can to figure out how our beloved nation, to paraphrase President Abraham Lincoln, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all are created equal, has allowed itself to stray from the ideals (and the promises those ideals hold out to all) upon which it was founded.

We are not, however, merely a university community. We are a Jesuit university community. And what does that mean for us and the work we must undertake? As I have told you before, I believe that the issues that divide and challenge our nation are moral issues. Therefore, I believe that precisely because we are a Jesuit institution, we have a special responsibility to reflect on the events of the past week and on the challenges that they have created for our nation in particularly moral terms. What do I mean? Just this: We can remind our students (and ourselves) that ?the situation in which the nation now finds itself is one that requires us to engage in an honest examination of conscience and consciousness so that we can be what God wants us to be. If we are willing to engage in this examination of consciousness, we will be able to take the first step toward the conversion of heart that will free us from the bondage of anger, frustration, and suspicion that holds us back.

I will not lie to you. The work of conversion is hard. And frequently it takes time. A long time. But I assure you that it is worth the exertion that it requires. The death of innocents calls us to it. The Gospel that has always stood at the center of our life and mission calls us to it. Therefore, let us all look into our hearts and see what justice would look like for the communities of color that are languishing and being crushed under the weight of racism in our country. Let us take to heart the loving invitation contained in the message issued on Friday by the United States Catholic Conference: “Encounter the people who historically have been disenfranchised [and]continue to experience sadness and pain and more authentically accompany them, listen to their stories, and learn from them, finding substantive ways to enact systemic change. Such encounters will start to bring about the needed transformation of our understanding of true life, charity, and justice in the United States.”

As I said, the work of conversion is hard, but if we commit ourselves to its rigors, we will be able to redeem the promises of our founding ideals for all of our citizens, who are (in the eyes of God) our brothers and sisters. Our beloved brothers and sisters.

You are in my thoughts and prayers today and every day.

Words are failing all of us in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. When leaders reach for words like outrage, horror, or despair, they only do more damage when they are not matched by action. As James Baldwin once famously said, “I can’t believe what you say, because I see what you do.”

So, no words without action. We are determined to keep George Mason University true to its motto, to be a place of “freedom and learning.” We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure every member of Mason Nation, and every visitor to our campuses, is safe: physically safe, emotionally safe, culturally safe, and intellectually safe, to become who they want to be.

To do that, today we directed the senior leadership of Mason to conduct a thorough review of our academic, research, public service, student service, campus law enforcement, and alumni offerings that contribute to social justice, racial equity, and peaceful conflict resolution. And we have directed them also to root out areas where we have fallen short of our intentions, through either conscious or unconscious bias.

Where we have services and expertise to offer a hurting, grieving community, we will step up – to the Mason community, to northern Virginia, to the national capital region, and beyond. We simply will not allow this moment to divert Mason from the long-standing pursuit of access to excellence, which is our ultimate tool to fight the perpetuation of racism.

And where we learn we have failed the diverse community we so proudly serve, we will direct necessary resources to fill the void. The COVID-19 pandemic has put us under unprecedented financial duress, but nothing is more strategically or morally vital to our future than truly living up to our mission to be an “inclusive academic community committed to creating a more just, free, and prosperous world.”

In the weeks and months ahead, we will have more to say about what we have to offer to advance social justice and healing, and about what changes we will make to improve how Mason will better serve the community and the nation as a whole. We invite you to stay tuned and be prepared to act with us.

Our nation is fighting two pandemics – the COVID-19 virus, and the pandemic of racism in America. George Mason University will address both with the same vigor and sense of urgency.

Like everyone in our community, I write to you today feeling sad and angry about the brutal killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, along with the racist incident in Central Park. 

I cannot begin to fathom the hurt GW’s Black students, faculty and staff may be feeling. My heart goes out to all who are suffering and may not feel safe. 

Please know that we continue to offer support and resources and are planning some online community events that are referenced in this message from Vice Provost Caroline Laguerre-Brown and the Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement.

While I wish we had the opportunity to host these conversations and support one another on campus, I know that we remain a strong community, and we will find ways to connect until our planned return to campus this fall. I look forward to working together—harnessing the power of the community that comprises this great institution—to address racism and injustice on our campus and in our society.

Dear Members of the Georgetown University Community: 

In recent weeks my communication with you has focused on the global pandemic and how we—as a Georgetown University community—are working our way through the challenges generated by a virus that has created a degree of dislocation and disequilibrium unlike any we have experienced in our lifetimes. In just three horrific months, one in four Americans has become unemployed and is looking for work. More than a hundred thousand people in our country have lost their lives to COVID-19. Our individual and collective routines and rhythms have all been disrupted. Although we are now beginning our tentative first steps toward a re-opening (under conditions of great uncertainty), we know we have much to do to rebuild our nation. 

In the midst of this devastating experience, the original fault line of our republic has been exposed once again for the nation. We grieve the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia as unconscionable acts of violence. Their deaths, and subsequent nationwide protests, once again present our country—and each one of us—with the imperative to confront the enduring legacy of slavery and segregation in America. 

On too many occasions over the years, there has been cause for me to share reflections with our community, as we grapple with the devastating impact of racism and hatred in our nation. In August 2014, following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; in December 2015, following the grand jury decision in the killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York; in August 2017, following the march of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia. In these moments, which encompass far from the full extent of experiences of racism and racist violence, I have tried to frame the work in which we must engage within the mission and purpose of the Academy. Our role in society—to pursue the truth—through the methodologies and disciplines through which we establish knowledge in our world, demands our engagement. In our response, we have sought to accelerate our academic commitment to addressing racial justice, and to address our own connection to the institution of slavery and the enduring legacy of racism and to undo the structural elements that sustain this legacy. 

We know this legacy is sustained by two elements: first, it is sustained by our own interiority—our beliefs and attitudes, our biases and prejudices, our ways of interpreting and making meaning in our world. Perhaps this element is unconscious, implicit, and unintentional, but it is nevertheless omnipresent and fundamentally influential. We also know that the very ideas of race and subsequently of racism are social constructs, the product of early American scholarship, developed and nurtured in order to justify the institution of slavery. 

The second element consists of institutional structures that perpetuate inequity and inequality. Consider what we have seen since mid-March with the pandemic caused by COVID-19: African Americans in our country have been hit disproportionately hard by COVID-19. 

A study by amfAR—the Foundation for AIDS Research, done in collaboration with colleagues at our O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, indicates that 22% of U.S. counties are “disproportionately black” and that these counties “account for 52% [of COVID-19 cases] and 58% [of COVID-19 deaths].” In a recent column, Michele L. Norris of the Washington Post indicated: 

“Blacks comprise 32 percent of Chicago’s population but nearly 70 percent of covid-19 deaths.” 
“Blacks comprise 26 percent of Milwaukee’s population but account for 73 percent of covid-19 deaths.” 
“Blacks account for 40 percent of covid-19 deaths in Michigan even though they represent just 14 percent of the state’s population.” 
“In Louisiana blacks make up 32 percent of the state’s population but 70 percent of those who have died because of the virus.” 
For the members of the Georgetown University community, this evidence of structural injustice in healthcare has animated the work of many of our colleagues for decades. Recently, through the work of our colleague, Professor Christopher King, PhD, we have a deeper grasp of the health disparities here in our nation’s capital. His 2016 report, The Health of the African American Community in the District of Columbia: Disparities and Recommendations provided a comprehensive presentation of the realities here in the District. In the coming days, a second report, Health Disparities in the Black Community: An Imperative for Racial Equity in the District of Columbia, will be released. Professor King calls us to the work of achieving the day “when race is no longer a predictor of a health outcome.” 

There are other structures—economic, educational, housing, criminal justice—that sustain inequity and inequality that are the enduring legacy of our American history. Coming out of these past three months, we know we have a nation to rebuild. We need to find ways to put forty million Americans back into the workforce and we must still contain a virus that remains a lethal threat to all of us. At the same time, we cannot return to a status quo that leaves inequity and inequality in place. As part of that determination, we must address the conditions that lead to the senseless and indefensible loss of life of our fellow citizens. We need to confront the violence that shapes the daily experiences of far too many, who expect so much more of us, as a people. We need to listen to the anger, the pain, the trauma that accompanies our failure to meet these expectations. 

This requires the work of each of us and of all of us. Individually, in each of our own interiority, we must determine how we contribute to perpetuating injustice and sustaining structures that cannot continue and that now must be reimagined. And, for us in our shared membership in this Georgetown University community, it remains for us in the Academy to contribute to this work of reimagining the social, political, economic and moral structures to ensure justice for all—and especially for those for whom it has been too long denied.

It is hard not to see a pattern of violence against black people when this tragic death comes on the heels of Ahmaud Arbery’s shooting right here in Georgia, Breonna Taylor’s in Kentucky, and so many others before them across our country. I acknowledge the pain many members of our community are feeling, and I stand in solidarity with our African American brothers and sisters and all people of goodwill, as we find a path forward. 

There is much soul-searching we need to do as a society. We all share in the responsibility to deliver on our foundational belief that all people are created equal and are endowed with the same fundamental rights. While we demand change from those with the power to enact it, we must also ask what each of us can do to make good on that promise. And that includes all of us at Georgia Tech. 

For the past few months, we have worked together on a new vision of inclusion, public service, and impact. That vision requires that we open the doors of opportunity to more people of underrepresented backgrounds. That we reduce barriers of access that still persist and that have nothing to do with talent. That we reject the status quo and do better. That we listen to and work with our students to create a more inclusive environment where people of all backgrounds can learn and grow. That we educate students who can think critically about the society we live in and can lead us to a better place. 

As scholars and researchers, we need to ask ourselves how the science and technology we advance and the theories and solutions we propose help all of us live better lives. As alumni and leaders in business and society, we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard of equal opportunity, inclusivity, and impact. 

Last September, we had the privilege to meet, listen to, and honor the first four African American students in the Institute’s history. That day helped me better appreciate our long struggle to become more just and inclusive — and how, by being more just and inclusive, we have become much stronger. Today, we must reflect on how much further we have to go. 

I encourage all of us at Georgia Tech to be true to our motto of Progress and Service, to deliver on our mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. Those aren’t just words on a page. We have a responsibility to our campus community, to our local community, and to our nation to help change our world for the better. We have a responsibility to empower and include more people, backgrounds, and perspectives in the process.

Gonzaga University,,3,3,https://www.gonzaga.edu/news-events/stories/2020/5/30/university-statement-on-the-death-of-george-floyd,"Dear Gonzaga Community:

Like so many of you watching the national news last evening and the days before, we at Gonzaga, and I personally, are very affected and troubled by the graphic images of George Floyd being traumatized, enduring physical harm at the hands of those assigned to protect people, and then dying in their custody. It is but the latest in a series of recent such incidents and I share the outrage expressed by protestors, so many of them our students' age, protesting in multiple cities across the country.

Gonzaga University is a community that has chosen to focus on and pay attention to systematic injustice. Our work is aided and supported by colleagues in areas such as the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and the Unity Multicultural Education Center (UMEC) within Student Development. We are blessed to have entities such as the Institute for Hate Studies, and the Center for Human and Civil Rights, that track and interpret events, like the murder of George Floyd – an action whose impact may well result in increased expressions of prejudice, racism, and bias. The work of these Institutes and Centers, as well as the courses and pedagogies developed in the Department of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies (CRES), Native American Studies, and in many other departments, from History to Women's and Gender Studies, aligns with and animates our mission to educate students for and with others.

At this critical juncture in US racial and ethnic history, it is important to remember that a founder of the Jesuits, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, was a member of a group now minoritized in their nation; a respect for difference is also at the heart of many Ignatian teachings. The fear equated with differences based on color, in this country, is profound, and has a particular pattern of having been codified and institutionalized in law, in practice, and in social and cultural values; it is a fear worthy of acknowledgment and of analysis. We are called, as is stated sometimes in common vernacular, to ""own"" this history as much as we obligate ourselves to resisting, interpreting, and evaluating behaviors borne out of racialized pasts.

The Gonzaga community joins with so many others in offering our condolences to the family of George Floyd, his brothers and sister who have shared their grief publicly, and share as well our concern for protesters displaying their grief and anger in ways that have also claimed lives and injuries. We are all cognizant of the impact destruction of property has on cities, in neighborhoods, and on the business owners who are in the path of the outrage expressed. While it is never appropriate to set fires, loot, or respond in physically injurious ways to officers of the law and to first responders, we have witnessed this level of emotion and destruction repeatedly across our nation’s history. Applicable to far too many events in the racial past of this country is what Dr. Martin Luther King named in one of his many exacting speeches: ""What is it that America has failed to hear?"" Increased militarization to ""restore"" order has its own problematic history; and as many seek a way to express their emotions or politics about George Floyd's death, and that of so many others before him, as a Jesuit, Catholic, and humanistic university, we can offer prayers, but we can do even more: to practice a faith that does justice, whether we endorse or support, or not, what is happening right now in this country's cities. I remember as a child in rural New Mexico hearing MLK's speech before the Los Angeles Democratic Club – to paraphrase but deeply etched in my memory: how the hot, burning fires of one summer, we must remember, followed a cold, cold winter of despair. It well may be that this, too, is what we are seeing before us, amplified in contexts of self-isolation or social distancing, and with far fewer visible outlets to mark poverty, anguish, and need.

As our university president stated in the context of the racial violence in Charlottesville, Gonzaga stands in solidarity with all those who oppose hate, who oppose prejudice, who oppose racism – and daily affirms its commitment to working proactively and constructively to create a culture and society where the dignity of each and every individual is treasured, honored, and celebrated, and the words “equity,” “inclusivity,” and “justice” are truly hallmarks of our way of proceeding.

Even as our own emotions are likely running high, may we listen carefully to, and help, one another, in this difficult national moment.

The nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd – and so many others – are stark reminders of how far we have yet to go to achieve racial justice. As Hanoverians, we must recommit ourselves to this cause.

While there is much to do as a nation, there is also much we can do as a college community. As I have said many times, Hanover College seeks to be more diverse and inclusive, but we must acknowledge our failures as well as our progress.

Although we cannot change history, we can confess it and learn from it. We can do better to welcome and support ethnic and racial diversity, diversities of sexuality and gender identity, neurodiversity, religious diversity, first-generation college students, the diversity of physical abilities, and working-class families.

For months, we have been working on Hanover College’s first Diversity Action Plan. A draft will soon be shared with the broader community for input and reflection. In it we will name concrete actions the College will take over the next one to three years to work for social and racial justice. But we know this vital work has no end date.

The pursuit of justice must be wide-ranging, but it begins with work within the learning community that we love. Thank you for supporting the changes needed to make Hanover College a more welcoming place for everyone to belong. And thank you for engaging as citizens in the pursuit of justice for all.

Harvard University,Ivy League,3,3,https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2020/what-i-believe?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=hu-twitter-general&utm_medium=social,"Dear Members of the Harvard Community, 

The last several months have been disorienting for all of us. COVID-19 has profoundly disrupted the lives of people worldwide. It has caused more than 365,000 deaths around the globe and more than 100,000 in the United States alone. Forty million Americans have lost their jobs, and countless others live in fear of both the virus and its economic consequences. 

In the midst of this incomprehensible loss, our nation has once again been shocked by the senseless killing of yet another black person—George Floyd—at the hands of those charged with protecting us. Cities are erupting. Our nation is deeply divided. Leaders who should be bringing us together seem incapable of doing so. 

I cannot help but think back to 1968, the spring of my junior year in high school. First, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, then Bobby Kennedy. Riots broke out in nearby Detroit, as they did across the country. Then, like now, our nation was hugely polarized, and we desperately struggled to find common ground that might unite us. 

At the time, hope was in short supply. It seemed difficult to imagine how we would move forward, but we did. As I think about the challenges that we face today, I return again and again to what I believe: 

I believe in the goodness of the people of this country—and in their resilience. 

I believe that all of us, liberal and conservative, Democrat and Republican, whatever our race or ethnicity, want a better life for our children. 

I believe that America should be a beacon of light to the rest of the world. 

I believe that our strength as a nation is due in no small measure to our tradition of welcoming those who come to our shores in search of freedom and opportunity, individuals who repay us multiple times over through their hard work, creativity, and devotion to their new home. 

I believe in the American Dream. 

I believe in the Constitution, the separation of powers, the First Amendment—especially the right to a free and independent press that holds those in power accountable, and to a free and independent judiciary. 

I believe in the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws—for everyone, not just for those who look like me. 

I believe that no person is above the law regardless of the office they hold or the uniform they wear. Those who break the law must be held accountable. 

I believe that one measure of the justness of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable members. 

I believe we must provide opportunity to those who may not encounter it on their own so that they may achieve their full potential. 

I believe in the power of knowledge and ideas to change the world, of science and medicine to defeat disease, of the arts and humanities to illuminate the human condition. 

This is just some of what I believe. I hope you will pause during these troubled times to ask what you believe. Even more importantly, I hope you will find the strength and determination to act on your beliefs—to repair and perfect this imperfect world. Those of us privileged to work or study at a place like this bear special responsibilities. As Luke teaches us, from those to whom much is given, much is expected.

Haverford College,,7,7,https://www.haverford.edu/college-communications-president/news/president-raymond-becoming-anti-racist,"Friends, 

I reach out to connect with you via words of invitation so that we can, together and individually, connect via action. 

I offer this invitation during a month of grief, fury, and fear across the nation about the killings of Black Americans George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, which come juxtaposed upon our increasing clarity of the disproportionately harmful impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of color in the United States. These killings are part of the growing list of killings of Black Americans that involve police or flawed law enforcement processes; these COVID-19 health disparities are part of systemic racial injustices in the US that include employment, health, public education, incarceration, and civil rights. 

To our Black students, staff, and faculty and to all our students and colleagues of color: I join you in grief, anger, and outrage while acknowledging—and decrying—that you bear the undue burdens of lives at risk and collective trauma when structures meant to provide civil and health protections fail. 

To those of you in the White majority at Haverford College, I seek to inspire and invite us all, and to inspire Haverford College, to grow our intellectual, social, and emotional intelligence about racism, inequality, and inequities - racism and inequities in America and racism and inequities in our own ways of knowing and being. We White members of this community need to take responsibility for doing this work. I invite all of us not yet on this path to join our students, faculty, staff, and alumni who already actively practice anti-racism, recognizing that the goal of anti-racism sits firmly in the educational mission and values of Haverford College, including the Quaker value of equality. 

For those not familiar with the term “anti-racist,” I invite you to see yourself in it and in our aspiration. I have compiled a set of resources below that is by no means complete but may provide a start. Please expand upon this; I welcome all suggestions. 

Thank you to those of you who are moving us toward this anti-racist aspiration, and for the many who have done so across Haverford’s history. In particular, I applaud our students and alumni, who often lead by alerting us to the ways and extents to which we must change—often whole cloth—in order to teach, mentor, and be in community inclusively. This generally requires persistence and risk, debts that we will owe perhaps forever, unless we might be able to pay them forward by the positive impacts of our anti-racist future. 

We have learned so much in a few months about a scourge previously unknown to humans – COVID-19. What are our reasons for allowing the scourge of racism to continue? Let us all apply our capacities to learn, create, adapt, discover, and thrive to becoming an anti-racist institution. For if not at Haverford, where? 

Words are important, and words are not enough. I hope you will accept my invitation to action. 

Yours, 
Wendy

Howard University,,5,5,https://newsroom.howard.edu/newsroom/article/12601/office-president-addressing-th,"Dear Howard University Community,

Recent months have cast a long shadow as the pandemic continues its deadly toll on the nation ravaging Black, Brown and Native American communities in particular. And in the midst of such anguish, the images of Black Americans treated without humanity and – in some cases – brutalized in the last moments of their earthly lives’ triggers waves of emotion including staggering grief and righteous anger. 

This constant attack on the Black experience must end.

I am the proud father of two precocious teenagers. Like many parents we have very purposely had “The Talk” – the unwelcome but necessary conversation about how to prepare for engagement with law enforcement. Watching these modern-day examples of social injustice and unrest in the presence of my 15-year-old son has brought up some difficult conversations. He reminded me of a time when we were heading to campus and were pulled over. I personally don’t recall all the details of that stop. However, my son vividly remembers the anger he felt as a result of the interaction. Upon seeing the news out of Minneapolis, he turned to me and asked, “Dad, should I just fall to the ground if a cop approaches me?” Praying for the right words to say, I told him that he should remain calm and try to express himself to the best of his ability. Yet, even after struggling through that conversation, the myriad names of innocent Black lives taken through lethal force – young and old, men and women – testify to the insufficiency of that advice. 

This moment of compounding crises leaves little doubt that the daily experience of so many in our community remain marked by heightened vulnerability and a likelihood to encounter deadly force at the hands of misguided individuals or those whose bigoted views betray the oaths they swore to protect and serve. 

Howard University emerged from the ashes of the American Civil War, a conflict that raised but hardly resolved the racial divide in this nation. Firmly rooted in a promise that offered the transformative power of education to all, Howard has consistently taught that the highest use of knowledge gained at the Mecca is demonstrated in service above self; focused on addressing systematic injustices and entrenched interests antagonistic to our enjoyment of life and liberty. Our scholars have enlightened, our physicians have healed, our lawyers have advocated, our activists have agitated, our entrepreneurs have built, our counselors have comforted, and our artists have enriched even life itself.

Our nation would be a shadow of itself and remain as imperfect as it was at its inception without the contributions of Howard University and all it stands for. 

In the context of current events there must always be accountability for all found responsible through a fair and thorough investigation so that justice is served. Yet even as we see individual perpetrators on our screens, we must remain mindful that the distorted worldviews and ugly biases have too often been codified into inequitable or predatory systems are equally culpable. The book of Ephesians reminds us “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”

We were born for such a time as this. And I am convinced that institutions like Howard University are destined to continue to build, mold and train the leaders who will help bring needed change to the structures of our society.

No pandemic, no declining economy, no period of prosperity, and no cure for every medical ailment will undo or hide the realities of the Black experience. We must bring consistency to that struggle and focus our intellect and passion daily to prepare for the hard work that must be done to confront evil and systematic oppression. 

As students: remain vigilant about your studies. You are matriculating through Howard University for a purpose that is greater than yourselves. You are the hope of our ancestors and despite the new challenges that will come our way, each day that you remain resolved to focus on your destiny is a day that brings us closer to resolution to many of our world’s dilemmas.

As faculty: continue to focus our energies and concern on our students so that they would be nurtured, thrive and excel. We all are intricately woven into the fabric of the Howard University legacy. Keep researching, writing, and speaking out to craft solutions to the contemporary challenges we face. We must be diligent in our work and conversations with students to hear and walk with them through these trying times. 

Let’s not forget that we are all living these experiences in our daily lives outside of Howard. It is everywhere that we are. Let’s first start by not looking past each other wherever we may be and work on actively loving each other. 

In this moment it is necessary to grieve over another life taken unnecessarily and those who loved him who are now broken and left behind to mourn. It’s okay to be angry. It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel numb. Stay there as long as you need to. I encourage you to take those feelings and channel them into something durable. Write about it. Sing about it. Participate in the electoral process and vote about it. 

We must remember the names of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor and the countless other lives gone too soon.

James Madison University,,1,1,https://www.jmu.edu/news/2020/05/31-buiding-a-better-tomorrow.shtml,"Dear JMU Students,

I write today with a heavy heart, deeply saddened and disturbed by the recent incidents of hatred and senseless acts of violence against people of color, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and other marginalized groups in American society. For far too long, we have witnessed tragedies and injustices that have resulted from our collective failure to live up to the promise of a democracy that is of, by, and for the people — all the people. We know this grief and pain extends throughout our community, and want you to know that on behalf of the institution and as an individual, I stand with you. We will do everything we can to help create a better tomorrow — one in which no individual has to live in fear that they may someday become a target of hate.

As an institution of higher education, James Madison University has an obligation to you, our students, that we will do everything we can to equip you to go into the world and address the systemic issues that plague our nation. JMU leadership, faculty and staff strive every day to create an environment that is conducive to that charge, that is diverse and inclusive, and where every Duke is respected and affirmed. And as an educational institution, it is our responsibility to call out these issues, critically examine the underlying causes, and identify ways to use our knowledge and skills to make positive change. At a time when there is so much hurt, fear and uncertainty, there is much work to be done on this front to make sure that as a university we emerge as a beacon of access, diversity, inclusion, and hope — accepting and embracing all differences.

You know better than anyone that at its core, the Madison experience is about people. JMU is a community of individuals from every imaginable background, and it is important in these times to address these challenges together, to build strength and solidarity among us, and to reaffirm our shared values of mutual respect and equity. For this reason, JMU will be hosting a number of virtual events including Virtual Town Halls, the first to be held this coming week, hosted by the James Madison Center for Civic Engagement, and a second the following week co-hosted by JMU Student Affairs and Academic Affairs. Details are forthcoming, but these events will be an opportunity for our community to learn from experts and discuss the role each of us has to play in creating a more inclusive society. Working with student leaders and organizations, we are also planning other events and activities over the summer on these issues. In addition, we are planning to host a variety of in-person events this fall during which we can focus on these topics together. Leaders within Academic Affairs are also having conversations about infusing these issues to an even greater extent in our curriculum and academic programming.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are proud of our students who have been working peacefully to build a more just nation, but it takes every single one of us being the change we wish to see in this world to make a measurable difference. We encourage you to attend the upcoming Virtual Town Halls. If you have ideas you would like to share, you can also be in touch with JMU’s Center for Multicultural Student Services, Office of Disability Services, Access and Inclusion Office, Madison Center for Civic Engagement, or Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression Office. We also encourage you to reach out to campus support services if you need help, including JMU’sDean of Students, or the Counseling Center.

Now, more than ever, we must lift each other up and affirm one another. Remember always that you have a home at JMU, as part of a community that supports you and is walking alongside you in our desire and demand for positive change and a better future.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Alger

Johns Hopkins University,,4,4,https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/05/31/johns-hopkins-statement-in-solidarity-against-racism/,"Dear Members of the Johns Hopkins Community, 

In the past three months, across the U.S. and around the globe, we have experienced extraordinary challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In communities of which Johns Hopkins is a part—from Baltimore City, Washington, D.C., Prince George's, Howard, and Montgomery Counties to St. Petersburg, Florida, and many more—we have witnessed our African American, Latinx, Native American, and poverty-stricken communities disproportionately dying from COVID-19, while our Asian and Asian American communities have been targeted with vitriol because of the disease's origins. People have lost family members, and the economic impact of this pandemic has led to many people having lost their jobs. 

This has been a tremendous burden for many to bear. The recent death of George Floyd in Minneapolis as well as the deaths of Breonna Taylor, a first responder in Louisville, Kentucky, shot in her own bed while sleeping; Ahmaud Arbery, shot while jogging near Brunswick, Georgia; and far too many others reinforce the brutal truth that the African American community still remains vulnerable to senseless violence, even during a pandemic. For those of us in Baltimore, these tragedies also call to mind the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody five years ago. And this moment serves as a reminder of the compounding effects on our communities. 

Because we are all intricately connected by our common humanity, if one segment of our community is hurting, it adversely impacts all of us. This is not just an issue for African Americans; it is an issue that threatens the future for all Americans. 

We hear the needs of the Johns Hopkins community to have an honest dialogue about these issues and develop steps to address them through our daily activities and relationships, scholarship and teaching, and health care delivery and leadership. We must acknowledge that these vulnerabilities to violence and health crises faced by black and brown communities are born out of continued racial disparities in education, employment, housing, and criminal justice. To that end, under the leadership of the JHM Office of Diversity and Inclusion and in collaboration with other groups across Johns Hopkins, we will host a Journeys in Healing symposium series, ""The Language of the Unheard: A Virtual Town Hall on Racial Injustice,"" in early June. More details will follow once dates have been solidified. 

We also recognize and acknowledge the anguish that these recent incidents are causing for our faculty, students, staff, trainees, and alumni across the Johns Hopkins family. We encourage you to access the many supportive services available. At JHM, these services include mySupport, Spiritual Care and Chaplaincy, the Office of Well-Being, the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and the JHM Office of Diversity and Inclusion. University affiliates can reach out to mySupport, find student wellness resources at wellness.jhu.edu or on the Student Outreach and Support site, or contact the Office of Institutional Equity for assistance. 

During this time of immense challenge, let us work together to be a light to facilitate education, healing, connection, support, and service to each other and to our community.

Kenyon College,,7,7,https://blogs.kenyon.edu/campus-report/post/thoughts-on-the-aftermath-of-recent-events/,"Dear members of the Kenyon College community, 

I have been president of Kenyon for seven years now, and I have lost count of the number of community messages or events mourning the loss of Black lives to police or vigilante violence. We’ve had faculty panels, marches, candlelight vigils. I’ve written letters and blog posts. We’ve had guest speakers and group readings. Yet this summer the tragedy continues to mount: Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd. And while I watched the video of Mr. Floyd’s life being senselessly and brutally extinguished, my deep sadness was exceeded only by my powerful anger. After nearly seven years of many of us asserting that Black Lives Matter, America consistently presents the Black community with evidence to the contrary. The nationwide protests are an expression of that anger, as well as a reflection of voices that have long been ignored or silenced. 

I know that many of you share this feeling of sadness and anger. There are not many words I can offer that can address this adequately, nor should there be: This is one of those moments when some may need to feel the anger for a while before it can be fully processed and focused. 

Yet no one becomes an educator, or pursues an education, without having some enduring optimism that can help us move beyond anger. The acts of teaching and learning are intrinsically about the future, about generations of students reaching their full potential and through their success improving the world around us. That is not an easy path, nor a straight one; and all of us make mistakes along the way. But undoubtedly, we were all drawn to Kenyon because we have hope, not only for a more just future, but for our ability to shape that future. 

In that spirit, I do have some suggestions on actions to take to help process our anger. 

Dissent is a critical component of a liberal arts education. Protest is a powerful form of expression of dissent; march if you feel moved to do so. Please be safe: There is guidance for safe practice at protests (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic) here, here (PDF) and here. There is a peaceful gathering on the square in Mount Vernon Monday, June 1, at 6 p.m. If marching is not for you, write, speak, talk to others, find ways to make your voice heard. 

If you are not familiar with the deep history and legacy of violence against the Black community in the United States, and how this has a powerful impact on the lives of all Black Americans, this is a good time to study. For history, I’d recommend Ibrahim X. Kendi’s “Stamped from the Beginning” or Jill Nelson’s “Police Brutality: An Anthology” as places to start. For policy proposals to reform policing, see Campaign Zero. If poetry is where you’d like to start, read Claudia Rankine's “Citizen” or Evie Shockley’s “can’t unsee.” If you prefer podcasts, try this episode of Code Switch, or an episode of the Ezra Klein podcast on health disparities by race. Or, take one of the great courses from our faculty in African diaspora studies. 

If you have the means, lend support to those who are struggling. This can take the form of simple outreach and emotional support (“I am here for you”). It can involve volunteering for efforts to reform the justice system and make it more equitable. It can mean contributing to efforts to support protests or support communities that have been impacted by the protests. Moreover, there is still work to do to make the Kenyon community more inclusive, and we can use the lessons of these events to examine and propose change here in Gambier. 

As I wrote in the aftermath of the Tamir Rice shooting in 2014, “all of us at Kenyon make a commitment to lead well-examined lives, to understand the complexity behind tragic events, to learn lessons from both history and present-day, and to apply these lessons as we move beyond the Hill. The study of the liberal arts is not intended to be an exercise in self-indulgence. Rather, we engage in the study of the liberal arts because of an ancient belief that an understanding of the humanities, of art, and of the sciences (natural and social) makes us better citizens.” Keeping this in mind, here in 2020 we can formulate a short-term path for moving forward: Raise our voices in dissent, educate ourselves about the matters at hand, and find ways to take concrete action, beyond Gambier and here on campus. 

Yours truly, 

Sean Decatur

Lafayette College,,5,5,https://news.lafayette.edu/2020/05/29/message-to-the-lafayette-community/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social-media,"To the Lafayette Community:

At a time when all of us have experienced a sense of fear and disempowerment as a result of COVID-19, it is important to remind ourselves that some members of our community have an enormous additional burden to bear.

The death of Ahmaud Arbery, the death of Breonna Taylor, and the death of George Floyd in an incident that has led to a police officer being charged with murder: these losses are tragic reminders of the risks that come with being black in America.

To compound the impact of these events, they take place against the backdrop of a national tragedy in which more than 100,000 people have died, with studies showing disproportionate losses in nonwhite, particularly African-American, communities. As analyses are already beginning to reveal, inequality and structural racism have had profound public health consequences in this crisis.

The anxiety and anger felt by many of us at this time are especially difficult to process when we do not have the opportunity to gather as a community. Were the College in session, we could organize discussions and gatherings that would provide opportunities for sharing, support, and activism.

Over the last few months, we have all learned to work hard at maintaining our sense of connection over long distances. I hope that even though we are far apart, we can look for opportunities to show support now and pledge action in the future. It is not enough simply to bear witness to racism and acknowledge that it exists. As an educational institution, Lafayette College has a role to play in revealing and countering its effects. That is a task that I promise you we will take up when we meet again.

Dear Loyolans,

Once again American society is witnessing outrage over the systemic racism that has led to the murders of women and men of color in the past weeks. The response understandably has been anger and fierce opposition to those who have betrayed their charge of upholding the law and protecting people by abusing their power and committing these heinous crimes of violence. Members of our own community feel these tragedies on a very personal level, yet again, and are not “all right.” We have also seen prejudice and hostility against people of Asian descent who are inappropriately being blamed for the outbreak of the coronavirus. We are keenly aware that members of black and brown communities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of infection and mortality. Naturally, we want to express solidarity with the individuals, families, and communities of color who continue to be victimized unjustly. But words are not and never will be enough. 

As I said in my address at last September’s Faculty Convocation:

... just issuing statements about tragedy and injustice is not the calling of our University, nor of me as our president. It is too easy for us to add our comments to a cacophony of others and feel in some way as though we did our part, took a stand, and will impact change through our mere words. The lists grow long with each successive horrible tragedy but are soon forgotten when the next tragedy strikes, which it does with predictable regularity.
In short, it is easy to just talk. The more that university presidents—the more that I on behalf of Loyola University Chicago—have to confirm formal opposition to sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, antisemitism, white supremacy, misogyny, domestic terrorism, or any of the social malignancies that tear at our democracy, the more ineffective such statements become. Make no mistake, we are vehemently in opposition to each and every one of these. However, our society does not need more statements from me. It needs more education and action from all of us.
I want to reassure everyone that I, as President, and we as the Loyola community are outraged at the acts of violence perpetrated by police against people of color in the United States. The real question is what are we going to do about contributing to healing this cancer within American society? Loyola University Chicago is called to reconcile, repair, heal, and educate. We are called to act.

I am calling on our Loyola community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni to find ways to come together and respond to the scourge of white supremacy and what Pope Francis has called the globalization of indifference. University experts, we need you and your expertise in law, medicine, public health, economics, ethics, criminal justice, social work, education, sustainability, history, sociology, and so many other vital fields now more than ever to help us ask the right questions and develop actionable responses. 

How do we begin to change our society, being unafraid to tackle the most vexing of society’s problems? How do we reflect right ordered relationships where possessions, money, and power are not more important than people? Channel your outrage and use the energy to devise solutions to these problems that plague us. Our people of color must stop having to live in fear of the police, in fear of getting mortally sick, and in fear of losing a dangerous, low-paying job because there is no alternative. This is our problem. We must address it because that is what we are called to do. 

I have asked Provost Grzywacz to bring together the experts across all of our schools to work together to offer concrete solutions to making change happen. An announcement from the Provost’s Office will be forthcoming this week. Let us pray for peace, for the victims and their families, for our society, and for our willingness and commitment, as Loyolans, to embrace the challenge that is before us.

Marquette University,,3,3,https://today.marquette.edu/2020/05/how-broken-must-our-world-be/,"“I can’t breathe…” 

These are haunting words, especially in the midst of a pandemic that has taken away the breath of more than 360 thousand people worldwide. How do we share our feelings of frustration at a time when we should be together but are so fractured by what Thomas M. Shapiro called toxic inequality, a dangerous conversion of racial and economic inequality? 

We are tired, overwhelmed and fearful. The evidence tracking the progress of COVID-19 in the United States has pointed to hot spots among the under-served, especially in black, brown and native communities. 

And remote access to education has laid bare our digital divide as students with little or no access to the internet have struggled to keep up with their work. 

And then there is George Floyd. A 46-year-old Black Houston native, who reportedly moved to Minneapolis in search of “a better life.” 

After being arrested for allegedly passing a counterfeit twenty dollar bill, Floyd lay on the street, his neck pinned under Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin’s knee for nearly nine minutes, gasping for air. “I can’t breathe…” 

Everything in Minneapolis and across the country seemed to fall apart, perhaps because Floyd’s death comes in the midst of a national pandemic of anxiety — owing as much to the allegations of racism and hate-based crimes as to the latest and deadliest coronavirus. 

Right now, I am reading an email from a friend who wonders what she as a mother of a black boy can do to “shield him from the ugliness of the world.” It troubles me that it seems that we as a society are begging for an end to racially-charged violence – physical, mental and emotional – inflicted upon people of color. 

As former President Barack Obama tweeted, 

“It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd’s death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station – including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day – to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.” 

What is our charge as a community guided by faith and the pursuit of knowledge? First, we must recognize what higher education leader Damon Williams said in a May 29 webinar on culturally relevant decision-making during COVID-19, “Trauma experienced in our community is at an ever, ever high.” He underscored that trauma transcends our culturally diverse landscape yet is elevated among the most vulnerable in our society. No matter how tough, it is crucial to discern over the brokenness of our society. 

Second, we need conversation now more than ever. We should talk out what Dr. Stephanie Rivera Berruz, assistant professor of philosophy, wrote in a March 24 Medium essay, “Human relations are not bookended by death. Death structures our sense of time, of what has and is to come, and as people of color our past is never quite past, and this pandemic will only layer the wake of our pasts that are still very present.” 

Although Dr. Rivera Berruz was referring specifically to the COVID-19 pandemic, these words can shape a much-needed conversation moving forward, one that cannot take a summer vacation. 

Lastly, conversation should guide us in the coming academic year as we embrace what Pope John Paul II referred to as the “duty of solidarity,” putting our knowledge, expertise, and faith into practice. 

Sometimes Twitter can take the pulse of immediate reactions and opinions. One clergywoman that I follow has been at a loss for words today, citing Jeremiah 9:21. Yet I offer these words tweeted by a singer from North Carolina as a prayer for our community: 

“Love costs nothing but self-awareness and the rewards are never ending. Hatred is fear’s child and will cost us everything.”",No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Ivy League,3,3,http://news.mit.edu/2020/letter-minneapolis-nation-community-0529,"To the members of the MIT community, 

At MIT, Commencement is the most beautiful day of the year. Even in this strange pandemic moment, this afternoon’s graduation celebration will offer us all the opportunity to celebrate the wonderful spirit, character and accomplishments of our newest graduates. 

That joy is and should be perfect and untouchable. 

But I write with a heart that is also full of anguish – because it is impossible to face this particular day without an overwhelming sense of concern for our nation. 

The death of George Floyd and the events unfolding in Minneapolis are deeply disturbing in themselves. And of course, they come on the heels of highly charged incidents, from Georgia to New York, that highlight yet again the tragic persistence of racism and systemic injustice in the United States. 

I know that the pain of these events is especially intense for certain members of our community, beginning with those who are African American and of African descent, though certainly not ending there. And I know that, in this time of tension around the pandemic and rising strains in US-China relations, others in our community are also suffering distinctive forms of harassment and discrimination. 

I imagine that you may share my urgent desire to help, while feeling an awful powerlessness to do so. At this moment, let’s do what we can. I believe a place to begin is by cherishing and seeking to strengthen our dear MIT community. Imperfect, certainly. But a community with an essential commitment to facing hard facts, thoughtfully striving to correct our errors – and working together to address humanity’s greatest challenges. A community where we aspire always to treat one another with sympathy, humility, decency, respect and kindness. 

Let us treasure and care for that community – and let us work to make it better. 

In the days and months to come, I would like us to find meaningful ways to come together to work on these challenges, for ourselves and for our society. I have asked John Dozier, our Institute Community and Equity Officer, to guide us in this effort. You may reach him directly at jdozier@mit.edu. 

For now: I take hope in turning my thoughts to the new graduates we share with the world this afternoon. Today is our beloved Commencement day, a day when we honor the achievements of our graduating students and charge them with helping to heal the world. That charge will be all the more meaningful now, grounded in the very present struggles for our nation and for the world.

We are living during a time of profound hurt, anger, frustration and, for many, a time of deep disappointment and despair regarding the recent high-profile violent events targeting Black Americans – the most recent being the inescapable images of George Floyd, dying while a police officer knelt on his neck. 

The shocking events in Minnesota, as well as too many other similar killings in communities including Ahmaud Arbery, killed while jogging, and Breonna Taylor, who was shot to death by police raiding her home, bring much pain, anger and trauma to many members of our community, and we cannot let them go unnoticed or unacknowledged. They are incomprehensible. Unjust. Inhumane. 

First and foremost, as leaders of this university, it is important that we speak out against these atrocities. To our Black students, faculty and staff, know that we both stand with you. The university stands with you. 

It is important, as Spartans, that we collectively understand and acknowledge the impact of racism and that the Black community is under attack in many ways right now. In addition to the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many others who are targeted because of their skin color, we have a global health pandemic that is powerfully and incontrovertibly revealing the inequities in our society. 

All of this is taking a heavy emotional toll on many of our friends, families and fellow Spartans. These events remind us that we have a responsibility to engage in the work necessary to understand we live in a diverse world and a diverse campus community, and by virtue of this we also have a responsibility to each other to respond to these injustices – acknowledge them, empathize with one another and accept each other. 

We are committed to building an inclusive environment here at MSU, one that recognizes and respects people of all backgrounds and experiences. However, this commitment must be manifested in ways that extend well beyond words. We hope you will do what you can as students, faculty and staff at MSU to fight racism, disrupt injustice and actively support each other. The next several months will test our resolve, our community and our nation.

Middlebury College,,4,4,https://medium.com/@acassel/statement-from-president-laurie-patton-34182bc9121b,"Dear Members of the Middlebury Community,
I have just listened to a recent interview with Albert Camus’s daughter, Catherine Camus.
She reports that she only started to read and understand the implications of her father’s classic work, The Plague, after he had died in a car accident.
Written from the perspective of a doctor in a small town, The Plague portrays how the pestilence strips away the relentless focus on material wealth and success and lays bare what really matters: human relationships, care, connection.
Like many of us who have recently returned to that classic, Catherine Camus was struck by its relevance today. Anything can become the plague, she observed. Anything can prevent us from being open to the deeper realities of life.
As others have observed, we are listening to two stories of plague this week.
The first, a searing account of a black man, George Floyd, killed by a police officer who kneeled on his neck for eight minutes while George Floyd died.
Like Eric Garner before him, George Floyd said these words as he pleaded for his life, “I can’t breathe.”
In light of this recent death and others (Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor), our country is again engulfed in anger and protest as the plague of racism infects the early days of our American summer.
The second plague is the one still taking place all over the country in nursing homes, in hospitals, in cities and rural communities. Young and old, people have trouble breathing as they are struck by COVID-19. We are learning about new techniques to help them breathe, whether it is a simple motion of turning face down to give the lungs more room, or a new kind of ventilator that allows more oxygen to flow.
These plagues have put into sharp relief the acute reality of life: People of color in our country walk daily with deep vulnerability to the threats of institutionalized violence.
They face greater risk of death in the time of coronavirus, greater risk of death on the streets and in their homes.
Education and action are the two forms of oxygen that can heal.
Wherever you are in the world, use your Middlebury education to challenge bigotry and hatred. Call your congressman or senator. Get involved in local groups. And when you return to Middlebury’s campuses, collaborate with all members of our community to act against racism and become accountable for the work that needs to be done — in our classrooms, in our living rooms, in our workplaces, in our communities.
This is an anxious and difficult time, particularly for students, staff, and faculty of color.
Even though we are dispersed, I want to remind you of our resources.
All students can visit Middlebury’s confidential counseling and referral services at WellConnect (https://bit.ly/middwellconnect) or call them at 866–640–4777. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Faculty and staff can visit the Employee and Family Assistance Program site (https://bit.ly/middEFAP) or call them at 800–828–6025, also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. (The institutional code is Middlebury College.)
Reach out to our intercultural center, the Anderson Freeman Resource Center, here https://bit.ly/middAndersonFreemanResourceCenter or at 802–443–2214 or email AFC@middlebury.edu.
Or the Scott Center for Spiritual and Religious Life at 802–443–5626. (https://bit.ly/middScottCenter)
Or Allies at MIIS at ccs@miis.edu.
Because many of us are still not in our offices, email or leave a message at the centers with your questions, and staff can provide support via email, phone, or Zoom.
In a world beset by two plagues, we are gasping for air. Just as coronavirus strips us of our capacity to remain connected, racism strips people of an opportunity to live in a just world that protects and supports all citizens.
I ask each of us, as members of the entire Middlebury community, to circulate that air so all of us can breathe it in, and live.

Once again, we find ourselves filled with sorrow, outrage, and grief over a loss of yet another Black person's life at the hands of law enforcement that was tragic, unjust, and avoidable. There have been numerous appalling events over the last few weeks during an already difficult time—a pandemic. While it is hard to find words to describe the shocking ghastliness of the videoed last minutes of George Floyd's life on a Minneapolis street, with a police officer's knee on his neck, the poignant and unheeded pleas of Mr. Floyd and the bystanders—as in previous occurrences—remain haunting. His cries tear at our hearts, just as the knowledge that events like this seem to happen again and again and again rips not only at our conscience but at what we all consider to be a just and humane society. 

This is one of those moments when reason and knowledge and discourse, which university citizens prize so highly, often doesn't seem like enough of a response. How could they be, when these deaths keep recurring, and when racism continues to manifest itself, even in our own community? 

But reason, discourse, study, evidence, analysis—those are our tools, and events like the killing of George Floyd should not cause us to set them aside, but instead to redouble our exertions to use them in the cause of addressing racism, xenophobia, violence, and hate to underscore social justice, human dignity, inclusion, and peace. Many of our scholars already study the issues so evident in the Floyd video—inequality, race, and the inequities of the criminal justice system. Over the summer, I will be examining—and I am sure this will be true for many of you, too—how else our University might contribute to the goal of creating more just practices and systems. In the meantime, on behalf of the NYU community, I offer our University's sympathies to the family and loved ones of George Floyd, with whom we grieve for his lost life and the unspeakable suffering to which he was subjected, as well all of those impacted by this and the other terrible recent events. To deal with these types of issues while simultaneously navigating a pandemic that is giving rise to differential impacts on communities of color, and in particular, those of African descent, is especially oppressive. 

Finally, my heart goes out to those in our own community who have been feeling overwhelmed by grief or apprehension because of fear for their own safety, their families, and loved ones. I want to remind you that NYU stands with you, and we have resources to help: for students at the Wellness Exchange, and for employees through Carebridge. And please also note that the Office of Global Inclusion (OGI) continues to plan events for the community. 

In sorrow with you all,

North Carolina State University at Raleigh,,3,3,https://diversity.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/30/statement-regarding-the-events-in-minneapolis/,"Dear Wolfpack Community,

George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery.

It is important that we speak these beautiful souls’ names. 

We call the names of those who have been victims of racism, violence and unjust treatment in this country — a list that is far, far too long — so that we actively reinforce the inherent value of the human lives that these names represent. Saying their names focuses our attention on our shared humanity as we strive for the just society they deserved but did not get — the just society that all souls deserve and that we must demand. 

Today, and every day, we denounce racism. We stand with advocates across the country and around the world in speaking out against discrimination in any form, and especially the deadly mixture of racism, violence and hate. We call in all persons of goodwill who join us in building an inclusive environment, at NC State and everywhere. Together we can build a community that fosters true belongingness and recognizes, respects and values people of all backgrounds and experiences. 

Our call and commitment, however, cannot exist solely as words on a page. We have to bring them to life, to action, to reality. We cannot wait or sit idly by. George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery — and so many others — deserve our active engagement in thinking and doing more, now.

No, these recent incidents did not happen here in Raleigh or on our campus — but that does not mean we cannot unite with the voices of many in speaking out. As Martin Luther King, Jr., said, in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” 

King’s words stir hearts and speak a truth that points to the inextricable connection that we all have to one another. The sad and unacceptable reality is that, despite how many times we call upon such quotes in moments of indescribable pain and grief as a call to action, there is still so much to be done, and still so much pain and not enough change.

I’ve held my head in my hands with the reality of injustice and with the range of emotions present in myself, and I am sure others have too. Shock and sadness. Outrage and heartbreak. Confusion and clarity. Grief and anger. Disgust and bewilderment. Numbness and rage.

In this time of COVID-19, while we profess that “we are all in this together” and that we are trying to shape an aspirational “new normal,” Americans of color are, again, among those disproportionately experiencing hardship. These stark reminders force us to look even more closely at the sharp and jagged contrast of this ever-present truth. The problems we have always faced as a nation are compounded during crisis.

While I write from a place of deep sadness, I also hold strong determination to continue and redouble our efforts toward co-creating a university that lives and breathes inclusion, belonging, equity and justice. We must actively work to eliminate injustice, disrespect, dehumanization and inequality when we see or experience them. This commitment must live as an integrated part of our “Think and Do” spirit.

I want to lift up the statement issued by Nubian Message, in which Nubian expresses “solidarity with the freedom fighters in Minneapolis,” aptly frames and names many of the critical issues and draws attention to the importance of speaking out and taking action.

I also wish to acknowledge and embrace that some of us may need help to process these very difficult events, and some may be seeking ways to educate and inform yourselves about these issues and how you can take positive, informed action or seek support. Below we offer some resources available online. Many of us are working to bring even more resources and action steps to our community soon. Those of us in OIED — including myself personally as vice provost — as well as partners across our university, are here now, and will continue to be here, working on this commitment, every day.

Let us all stand together as we work to build a just and inclusive NC State community, one that does not tolerate unjust or inhumane treatment, and that denounces it, clearly and loudly, when we witness it anywhere in the world.

Our university’s Strategic Planning Task Force for Advancing Diversity, Inclusion and Well-Being is currently engaged in drafting a new vision, a new “normal” for NC State. This work could not be more important right now. We would value your input via the Strategic Plan Task Force website and invite those that are ready and willing to share your thoughts and ideas with us.

In solidarity.

To all members of the Northeastern community, 

For the past several months, a lethal pandemic has tested every level of society. Families everywhere have faced the loss of loved ones and the distress of financial insecurity. The institutions that shape our lives, including colleges and universities, have suspended normal operations. 

But the closure of our campuses does not mean the closure of our minds. And we can never close our hearts. While COVID-19 has required us to be apart, opposing inequality and working for social unity require us to join together. 

Racism, hatred, and ignorance—these are the scourges of a different kind of virus. To halt its spread, it is our obligation to work every day to embrace diversity, inclusion, and harmony. It is our mission to pursue knowledge through love, progress through compassion. 

As many of you know, I grew up in a land that was torn apart by sectarian violence. Witnessing the corrosive effects of hatred instilled in me a set of core values—that all people must be treated justly and equally. Growing up, America was always a shining beacon for these ideals. Sadly, as current events have reminded us, there is much work left to be done. Consider for a moment that the leading cause of death among young African American men is homicide. This is both incredible and unacceptable. 

COVID-19 does not recognize skin color, but it has exacerbated the inequality and racism that afflict our society. Communities of color are suffering in profound ways. The virus has hit them hardest; the economic collapse has impacted them disproportionately; and the ugliness of persistent racism has marginalized them systematically. 

In the words of Dr. King: “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character—that is the goal of true education.” As a community dedicated to learning and enlightenment, it is our duty to combine intelligence with character. It is our duty to ask: What will we do to make the world better? 

Let us begin today, right now, to mend the torn fabric of society. As we move to reopen our campuses, our core values of inclusion, equality and harmony will be our guiding lights. Our mission of discovery to make the planet healthier, safer, and sustainable has never been more urgent. The world has never seen a greater need for learning to lift millions of people from despair. We cannot achieve these goals if we are divided against one another. 

Together, let us take up the work of healing. Let us use our voices not just to call for a better society, but to create one. 

Sincerely,

I felt outrage and disgust watching video of the fatal mistreatment of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 

And I was further sickened this morning when our recent graduate, CNN’s Omar Jimenez, was arrested live on television for, as Medill Dean Charles Whitaker described it, “the sin of doing journalism.”

Our Northwestern community grieves for the many ways in which our society tolerates and facilitates injustices, demonstrated so vividly in these and other recent events. 

Dean Whitaker poignantly expressed his personal pain as a father of African-American sons. Many of the rest of us can barely begin to imagine the personal toll that racism takes on marginalized communities every single day. But we can all increase our resolve to create a Northwestern community, and a world, where all people are accorded the dignity and the safety they deserve.

Oberlin College,,3,3,https://www.oberlin.edu/president/communication-president-ambar,"May 31, 2020

To the Oberlin Community, 

These last few days I have found myself at a loss. At a loss for words. At a profound loss of self, and at a loss for a community that I love, and of which I am a part. 

At every turn it seems we are watching in anguish a world that views African-Americans as less than human and unworthy of dignity. Not deserving of life itself. The black community – my community – is in excruciating pain. We are contending with what appears to be an unending well of racism and bigotry.

George Floyd’s agony was palpable. It would be natural for some to avert their eyes. To reframe recent events and to make them singular so that they do not seem like a societal ill, but rather a moment in isolation. But I can assure you that these events are not isolated and they are not singular.

We are witnessing an unraveling and a democracy that is now in search of its foundational societal norms. Hatred, anger, illness and death fill our screens. There is grief at the abandonment of our ideals and a tearing of the heart as we see the impact on our children.

Sending young people out into the world to reshape it, and to make it different, is how I have spent my career. Oberlin has had from its founding a commitment to solving racial inequity. We view our institution as a place where students come first to be educated, but where they also translate that education into something more. We seek understanding and creative ways of advocacy. We work so that the marginalized are no longer at the edges but rather at the center.

It is clear that we are falling short as a nation. Every George Floyd reminds us of the truth. We wonder if we are standing still, or even worse, if we are retreating. 

Yet, each day I hope. I hope because I simply refuse to despair, and because I see reason to hope every September. My hope is with the students who grace this campus. Every year we observe a different unending well here at Oberlin. Students arrive in the fall with a seemingly insatiable level of curiosity, a love and appreciation of difference, and an unyielding view that what has always been, does not have to be.

My hope is with our students. Hoping that they will have the courage to face the world as it is, and to be unrelenting in their desire to see it change.

To that end, this upcoming year I will establish a Presidential Initiative for faculty and students that seeks to address issues of violence, police-community relationships, and racial injustices. One could imagine courses, co-curricular initiatives, community engagements, and internships focused on the very issues that the death of George Floyd invokes. The primary goal of this initiative is not purely for learning, but for learning that demonstrably is applied to our world.

This small effort will not change what happened to George Floyd, but it is in keeping with who we are at Oberlin. I believe in our students and their impact on a generation that can place our nation back on the right path.

My hope is with our students. I see their passion and commitment and desire to do good in the world, and it moves me.

This country needs that hope now more than ever before.

Members of the OSU community,

The primary role of police in America is to provide for the safety of all people by protecting them from criminals and to hold each of us accountable to the law. We expect police to apprehend criminals and work within the legal system to make certain that justice is blind and all are held accountable to the law.

We all have watched in horror videos being replayed over the past week showing the life of George Floyd brutally taken from him by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minn., while three other officers sworn to uphold the law looked on in indifference. The officer who killed Mr. Floyd was arrested and all four of the officers were fired, but the other three officers simply went home.

Sadly, this horrific event is just the latest in a seemingly endless stream of acts of violence against Black and other people of color by police who are sworn to protect and serve them.

Mr. Floyd’s death comes on the heels of the Feb. 23 fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery by armed white residents as he was out jogging in a neighborhood in South Georgia. As well, the March 13 death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot in her Louisville, Ky. home by police. And the reporting to police last week of an African American man threatening a white woman when in fact he was in New York City’s Central Park to watch birds and simply asked her to keep her dog on a leash.

We continually hear speeches and testimonials about how unacceptable and terrible these acts are and how our leaders feel the pain of the Black community. Yet, nothing changes much and we act as if these horrific events are singular or isolated events. But these are not one-offs. They are the product of a failed justice system that perpetuates racism in America and too often a culture of silence within police forces that protects incompetent and hateful people simply because they wear the badge. We are condemned to relive these tragedies unless we make real change a priority throughout this country.

America must be a land of personal and equal freedom, safety and opportunity for all people. And to be certain, the police exist to protect us from predators and not to control us. That attitude should be universal in this country regardless of who we are, where we live or what we look like.

But how can we expect America and all people who live here — including communities of color — to thrive in the midst of such violence and injustice? How many times must we write the same messages expressing our outrage and hurt, sharing our thoughts and prayers for those harmed, and pleading for an end to injustice? How many acts of discrimination, injury and death must occur before our country confronts the realities of the lived experiences of people of color in our society? All of this must stop and that requires action not speeches.

Policing is a local function, but our system of policing requires systematic change across the country. On Monday, I will write the National Governors Association and urge the association and other groups to develop rules, training programs and disciplinary codes for appropriate policing to be enforced throughout America and for unions to step up and support the justice system in weeding out bad officers. Most police are good, dedicated, under-paid and hard working men and women, who risk their lives every day for the well-being of all people. They deserve our thanks and respect and they should not be subject to public scorn because we are incapable of holding some police accountable to the laws of our country and communities simply because they wear a badge. 

As a university community, we must join together to ensure that all members of the OSU community — students, faculty, staff and visitors — not only feel welcomed and safe, but experience our community as a place to thrive. Each and every member of our community must know they are valued, that they belong here, and that we celebrate the rich diversity that they bring to Oregon State University. We should not tolerate anything less. 

Our new police chief, Edgar Rodriguez understands that police must be a community partner that provide a sense of safety in the university and broader community. As we hire officers for our police force, the Office of Institutional Diversity will continue to provide training to OSU public safety officers on implicit bias, foundations of power, privilege and oppression to ensure that our public safety practices are congruent with OSU’s values regarding inclusivity and opposing oppression. University leaders also will to seek to achieve agreements with police agencies in communities where OSU operates so that we may mutually advance inclusive justice for all people. 

The novel coronavirus pandemic has made all of us look at the inequities in our society. We call people essential workers and yet we systematically pay them less than living wages and deny them critical health care and quality education for themselves and their children, and we act surprised that they are disproportionately vulnerable to death from the COVID-19 pandemic because of pre-existing conditions and that they are disproportionately people of color. When do we get disgusted enough with what we have created and say enough? 

We have a policing problem in America, but it is part of a much deeper and broader failure of this society to live up to the promise of America, which continually eludes us.

As I prepare to step down as university president on June 30, I am confident that our university and the OSU community are in the right hands with incoming president King Alexander. He and I talk often and I know he shares my personal values and leadership commitment to inclusivity, safety and opportunity for all. I know that as OSU’s next president, he will be unwavering in helping advance the work of inclusive justice and opportunity for all that must be part of life within OSU — and across America. Together with Chief Rodriguez, he will help us move in the right direction in our little part of the world.

In closing, I ask that each of us continue to participate in dialogue, leadership and understanding as we seek to alter the direction of society. I know this will not happen overnight, but by God it needs to happen soon.

The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, following other recent unspeakable tragedies, makes clear yet again that systemic discrimination and unjust racial disparities continue to plague our country. It is past time for change. 

We cannot remain silent in the face of this heart-breaking reality. As an institution of higher education, we have an obligation to fight ignorance and intolerance, model inclusivity and embrace the power that diversity represents. 

In the face of hatred and bias, we must speak out. We must not accept apathy, indifference or silence, otherwise we allow hatred, prejudice and intolerance to grow. 

Our message today is, foremost, one of profound compassion for all who live in fear that the color of their skin, gender identity, ethnicity or religion makes them a target of hate. Our hearts ache as we can only imagine the trauma, pain and frustration that many are feeling at this time. 

This message also reaffirms Penn State’s commitment to disrupting hate, bias and racism whenever and wherever we encounter it, and to creating the most inclusive and diverse community that we possibly can – one that is free of discrimination; one that embraces differences; and one that respects all individuals. 

We support our community as you express your sadness and anger through peaceful protest, and we know it is even more challenging to support and lift each other up during this global pandemic, with the added difficulty of social distancing. However, please know that our entire University community grieves with you, supports you and joins with you as we strive for positive change.

My dear Pratt community,

Like many of us, I am outraged and grieving the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, Tony McDade in Florida, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. These deaths and countless other acts of racial violence against the Black community have ignited protests across the country and here in Brooklyn, including at our own 88th police precinct across from our campus. It is further heartbreaking that this is happening at a time when people are already isolated, disheartened, struggling economically, and frightened about the future.

I believe it is important to restate firmly that Pratt Institute condemns injustice, discrimination, and racism in all forms, and maintains our unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are listening and stand in solidarity with all of our colleagues, friends, and neighbors through this suffering and upheaval.

While Pratt’s campus remains closed by pandemic regulations, our essential workers continue to care for and protect our spaces, and in turn, we remain vigilant about protecting these workers and our entire Pratt community. We encourage students, faculty and staff who need additional support to reach out to available Pratt resources for assistance. Students can contact the Pratt Counseling Center twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week at 718-687-5356. Faculty and staff can seek support through Pratt’s Employee Assistance Program which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 1-800-311-4327 (TDD 800-697-0353). More information is available online. Faculty and staff can also access Emotional Support Resources on Pratt’s website.

As a member of the Pratt community, the greater Brooklyn community and a nation of neighbors, I join with all of you in our respect and care for one another. As your president, I renew my commitment, and the Institute’s commitment, to work to eradicate racism and injustice through our curriculum, our outreach, and our mission.

Please continue to look out for the health and safety of your loved ones and yourselves.

The heartless killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis occurred soon after the unjust shootings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.

Dear Reed community,

This week, the tragic death of George Floyd weighs heavily on my heart. The unspeakable video images of Mr. Floyd’s last moments bear witness to a reality faced by black people and people of color every day in this country: racism is a constant threat, and daily activities like driving, jogging, shopping, and simply walking home pose danger. Mr. Floyd’s death follows other widely publicized (and innumerable unpublicized) racist acts that have taken or diminished the lives of black people and other people of color. Communities of color are experiencing a heightened sense of danger and exhaustion, resulting in more public and widespread expressions of pain, suffering, fear, and outrage. I am united with you in grieving the unconscionable acts of violence that stem from racism.

I came to Reed because Reed has made the commitment to becoming an ever more inclusive community, including putting into practice the goals and aspirations reflected in our diversity and anti-racism statements. Today we recommit ourselves to those goals, both by examining our individual actions and by interrogating and reforming our institutional structures, policies, and practices to mitigate the harmful effects of racism on our community—past and present.

In addition to these most recent and explicit acts of racism, I also acknowledge the less visible but persistent and pervasive forms of racism that people of color encounter on a daily basis. While I offer my words of support and solidarity, I am keenly aware that they will provide little comfort and are not enough. We as a community, nation, and world must continue to work for change and speak up and out in the face of injustices, particularly those injustices that we have agency to interrupt.

My heart goes out to you all.

Rice University,,4,4,http://news.rice.edu/2020/06/01/leebron-we-must-act-to-reduce-deadly-discrimination-and-racism/,"Rice President David Leebron sent the following message to the university community May 30: 

We draw many things from being a community. We do things collaboratively. We define and share our values. We take collective joy in our successes. We commiserate when there are reasons for sadness. And we come together in times of crisis and danger. 

Over the summer, when our students and also to some extent our faculty are dispersed, the immediate sense of community and our ability to rely on it is diminished. This year that is even more so since our education has been completely online since March. And although our students may still be seeing each other in classes on screens, many of the casual interactions that build our connections to each other no longer take place. 

There is of course great sadness sweeping across our world and our country because of the pandemic. Many have lost friends and family members. Many more are living in isolation and under constant threat of danger to their health. Tens of millions have lost their jobs, and collectively our country is facing a level of unemployment and financial distress we have not seen in 90 years. And these burdens have fallen unequally on different communities. 

And yet, amid all of that, there is now a deep pang of pain sweeping across America that cries out for recognition, that demands that our voices be heard. 

Just three weeks ago I wrote on Twitter about the horrific shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed while jogging in the coastal city of Brunswick, Georgia, in late February. In mid-March, Breonna Taylor, a young emergency medical technician in Louisville, Kentucky, was killed in her apartment when police entered. And last week, George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis when an arresting officer knelt on his throat for over eight minutes. 
What these recent cases, and others, have in common is that they all involved victims who were black Americans. Black Americans who were treated as a threat when they weren’t. Black Americans who were treated as if they did not belong in a place when they did. Black Americans who were treated as if they were not a vital part of the fabric of this nation when they have fought and died and sacrificed for it as much as any others. Black Americans who were killed when the circumstances provided no justification. 

There is anger and pain and fear across America, not because these are new things to deal with, but because they aren’t. Last fall, for example, Atatiana Jefferson, a young Xavier University graduate working in the pharmaceutical industry, was killed by a police officer who entered her home in Fort Worth, Texas, without identifying himself. The names of these victims are seared in our memories. 

For the most part, I write to the campus about events only when they directly involve Rice, and usually when our campus is in session. But occasionally, external events, nearby or far away, are such that they reach deeply into our community and especially affect a valued part of the Rice community. And so although we are currently dispersed and these incidents did not directly involve members of the Rice community, we must acknowledge that these events cause pain and fear to a vital part of our community. It is a pain and fear that many of us have trouble even imagining. Even in the middle of a global pandemic, it is a deep and enduring pain and fear that deserves acknowledgment and caring, and recognition that we must do better. 

We must therefore join with our own expressions of concern and sympathy and outrage. We must work to build an inclusive environment, one that respects and values people from different backgrounds. We must take part in efforts to reduce the deadly discrimination and racism that is an unstaunched wound in our national fabric. 

And so I write today to convey on behalf of the Rice community, to all of our community, and most especially to the black members of our community, that we acknowledge the sorrow and the fear and the pain. And that we know as a university and as individuals we must contribute to healing that wound.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,

It is hard to find words to express the collective hurt, anger, and shame our nation is feeling. It’s particularly hard as we’ve been here before and we haven’t realized the needed change. We haven’t put racial inequity behind us. We have failed to right the wrongs built up over centuries.

We again face a highly disturbing situation that regrettably has become all too familiar — the senseless death of yet another black man, George Floyd. The most recent ferment follows a series of high-profile incidents of violence against people of color. As protests continue across the nation, the outcry from all who value justice and equity demands our attention and response. While we strongly condemn the rioters who have incited violence, we wish to recognize the altruistic majority that is heartbroken. Our country is hurting; our cities are hurting; our RIT community is hurting. 

We have a responsibility at RIT to be part of the world, not set aside from it. We strive to create an environment that encourages free inquiry, free expression, and community involvement. Members of the RIT family express, vigorously defend, and openly promote their ideas and opinions. Now is the time for our community to help foster productive dialogue and actions that extend beyond our campus. We must act to ensure a strong future for all. Social reformer, writer, and Rochestarian Frederick Douglass once said, “The life of a nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous.” His words from more than one hundred years ago still ring true today.

We may not be together on campus at this time, but we cannot let distance prevent us from envisioning a course for change. Working with our Division of Diversity and Inclusion, we invite you to be attentive to opportunities that allow for discussion and further education regarding these difficult topics.

During this challenging period, we encourage those who need support to call on the Division of Diversity and Inclusion. Students also can access services through our Case Management Office or Counseling and Psychological Services.

At this critical time, let us show the strength of RIT’s character and use it to foster a healthier climate of respect, inclusivity, and equity for all.

Dear members of the Saint Louis University community, 

I am aware of the disappointment felt by some because we had not yet issued a response from the University and from me about the death of George Floyd, and the protests that have followed. 

Let me be abundantly clear, Saint Louis University mourns the loss of Mr. Floyd, and we stand in stark opposition to the systemic racism that took George Floyd from his loved ones. 

I want to assure the black members of our community that I see each and every one of you, and that I care about you. That we at Saint Louis University care about you, we see your pain, and we grieve with you. I am grateful for your presence and contribution to our university community. 

These faculty, staff, students, trustees and benefactors shape and transform us. Without them, as well as without each one of you who is reading this message, Saint Louis University loses meaning, purpose and any compelling reason to identify itself as Jesuit or Catholic. 

We know this pain and sense of mourning runs deeper than what happened on May 25 on that Minneapolis street. This is about the black lives lost and limited, not from natural causes, but from the sin that is racism. We mourn for Breonna Taylor. And Ahmaud Arbery. And Sandra Bland. And Philando Castile. And Michael Brown. And Vonderrit Myers, Jr. And tragically, the list goes on and on. 

This is about the countless, pervasive ways institutions, policies, programs, and systems are structured in a manner that oppresses people of marginalized identities. 

As a University and as individuals, there is much work to be done and we all have a part to play. You may not know how to start, and that is okay. But we must start. Read, listen, reach out to one another and offer empathy and support. Listen intensely and seek understanding. 

Every waking moment of the last several days, I have prayed about what I want to say to you and what we ought to do. One of the thoughts that I could not shake was this, “What did we say the last time this happened?” 

The last time. 

Statements are, quite simply, not enough. They were not enough the last time. And they will not be enough this time. But we are and can continue to do something before the next time. 

A group of institutional leaders, including several students, are discussing and working toward intentional, institutional next steps. 

As I have said before, “For those in our community who are feeling scared, tired, weary, or wondering when or if we will see the day where the hateful rhetoric and dehumanizing violence come to an end, you are not alone. Solidarity and community mean that we never have to face such evil alone.” 

That was true then. It is true now. And it always will be true. 

In solidarity,

Saint Mary's College,,5,5,https://www.saintmarys.edu/inclusion-and-equity#OurStandOnRacism,"June 1, 2020

Dear members of the Saint Mary’s College community,

This past weekend, hundreds of protests were organized across the United States and around the world demanding attention to racial injustice. Communities are calling for action, insisting that we — individually and collectively — must take a forceful stand against racism, speak out for racial justice, and embrace the plain truth that Black lives matter. The murder of George Floyd and the tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless others, have incited outrage, and we believe this is righteous anger. In the broader community of South Bend, the 2019 death of Eric Logan and its divisive after-effects show that right here in our city there is much work to be done.

Our country’s current unrest takes place in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, and all evidence points to the ways that communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by this global health crisis. Our health systems, our criminal justice systems, our political systems, and even our educational systems cry out for reform, and that reform begins with the eradication of systemic racism.

In 2018, Saint Mary’s College created a statement in which we declared our commitment to fight for justice for all marginalized, victimized populations, and we pledged actively to disrupt the dehumanizing effects caused by systemic and individual racism. We write to you today to reiterate that commitment and offer the full statement:

As a Catholic institution of higher learning, Saint Mary’s College has a mission-driven responsibility to be diverse, inclusive, and equitable. We believe in the inherent value of diversity in its multiple dimensions, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, culture, religion, nationality, geographic origin, beliefs, ideas, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, gender expression, ability, veteran status, and age. To honor that value, the College is committed to creating and maintaining an environment that respects the human dignity and civil rights of all persons, particularly those from groups that have historically experienced discrimination and persecution. By actively resisting bigotry and marginalization, we endeavor to work against the effects of past injustices and to dismantle current forms of injustice. In particular, we recognize the insidiousness of systemic and individual racism, both intentional and unintentional, and we strive to actively disrupt its dehumanizing effects. We expect every member of the Saint Mary’s College community to uphold these commitments in our programs, practices, pedagogy, and policies.

If we are to fulfill our College’s values — including those of community and justice — we challenge ourselves and you to commit to: 

Engage in continuous learning to understand the challenges of communities impacted by racial injustice
Develop an awareness of our own biases and work towards overcoming them
Call out racism and injustice wherever we see it
Honor the experiences of others by listening and validating their narrative
Foster friendships with people from diverse backgrounds
Support organizations that are committed to addressing issues of diversity, inclusion, and justice
Support policies and laws at the federal, state, and local levels that address disparities in educational opportunities, health care, housing, and law enforcement. 
The Saint Mary’s College Office of Inclusion and Equity serves as an essential resource in furthering our emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion. Please visit the Office’s web page frequently to avail yourself of the many resources, and watch for Saint Mary’s College programming related to these issues in the coming weeks.

As we draw on our faith, we pray for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, the many Black and Brown victims of police brutality and violence and all others who have lost their lives in a similar manner. We pray for comfort for grieving families, friends, and members of the Saint Mary’s community. But we know that prayer alone is not enough. We are called to open our hearts, join our voices, reaffirm our commitment to overcome prejudice, and work for the dismantlement of systems that oppress our sisters and brothers.

Today, I wish to lend my voice to the conversations surrounding the heartbreaking events that are occurring in our nation, the latest of which is the death of George Floyd. This is a sad reminder that there is still much work to be done.

As we embark upon our 250th anniversary, celebrating being the first and oldest women’s institution in America, an institution that is proud to have been in existence before there was even a United States of America, we see much has changed, yet I am horribly struck by how much has remained the same. The recent events in our nation highlight, once again, the systemic racial inequality and injustice that prevent us from living up to our highest ideals. As an institution, Salem has also grappled with her racial past and how that past called us to acknowledge that role in our history and challenged us all to see the experience and value of others.

Salem remains, as one of our core values, unapologetically committed to honoring equity, diversity, and inclusion and to the ongoing work of dismantling systems of racism and oppression. We embrace each individual for the value of their experiences that add to the Salem community and the expanded community our students and alumni strive to positively impact every day.

The coronavirus crisis impedes our ability to connect with one another in ways that we desperately need at this moment. We are available to support you in any way we can.

Salem will be relentless in our commitment to addressing the systemic inequalities and injustices in our society. We will be here, working together over the coming months and years, for however long it takes, to create a more just world, a world that will make us all proud. We, and society as a whole, deserve that reality.

Ever Salem,

Samford University,,4,4,https://www.samford.edu/departments/president/messages/2020-06-01-Message-to-the-Samford-Community,"Dear Samford Community, 

Like you, my thoughts in recent days have been dominated by the video of the horrific killing of George Floyd. Sadness overwhelms my other emotions this morning. Anger, of course, is fueled at least in part because the video of Mr. Floyd is one of far too many examples of injustice. We feel the pain in the depths of our hearts. 

Especially to our African American students, employees, alumni and friends, I want to express to you my solidarity—and the support of the thousands of families who comprise Samford—during these days in which painful memories are inflamed by recent, thoughtless tragedies. We love you, each one of you. 

Systemic racism does not endure simply due to corrupt systems; it endures because of hatred within individual hearts, sometimes known and sometimes not, a hatred that corrodes lives, families, institutions and nations. Hatred consumes all. 

It remains important to me and to so many others at Samford to do whatever we can, day by day and course by course, to help each of us understand and practice the ways in which we can build a better future not just for ourselves, but for everyone. We cannot grow weary in pursuing those goals. I appreciate the dedicated partnership of so many friends, near and far, as we walk toward progress. 

I am drawn today to a portion Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, from the second chapter: “For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.” 

It is ironic that we had planned to release today a story about a long-planned Reconciliation Memorial at the west end of the Quad, near Divinity Hall. Throughout the past year, more than 50 individuals and groups representing a broad cross-section of university life determined the inscriptions on the memorial. The style, an obelisk, is patterned after the grave marker for the man we know as Harry, an enslaved African American who lost his life by rescuing students—white students—at Howard College during a fire in 1854. The memorial will forever remind us of Harry and other African Americans, enslaved and free, who have made significant contributions to Samford. The closing of the campus due to COVID-19 kept us from observing a public dedication of the memorial, which was scheduled for May 5. The Reconciliation Memorial represents our attempt to engage in honest conversations about our past, prompting hopeful consideration of our future. It is only one step along this path, but nonetheless an important step. You may read the story of the memorial here: https://www.samford.edu/news/updates/reconciliation-memorial. 

Especially today, you are in my prayers. Be safe. Be strong. Be filled with grace.

Dear Seattle University Community,
I write to you today with a heavy heart as someone deeply impacted by the recent killing of George Floyd, the ensuing desperation and frustration on display in Minneapolis, and the other related incidents of racism and bigotry that have occurred over the last few weeks, including the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, as well as the act of racial aggression born upon Christian Cooper. We are living in unprecedented times of a pandemic and witnessing the enduring problem of systemic racism in our country. I acknowledge the crushing weight of this moment and its haunting familiarity.
This message will be brief because I am filled with emotion as so many of you have expressed. I struggle to know whether I can offer anything at all that will be helpful. Words matter – they can help clarify and heal; but I found myself at a loss for words as I watched the footage of the officer’s disregard for George Floyd’s life and his cry for help. There is so much more I wish to convey, but I am processing these events in real time as a leader, citizen, and a black woman deeply impacted by these tragic circumstances. At this time, I offer the following statement on behalf of leadership at Seattle University.
As the university’s Chief Diversity Officer: 
I write to affirm the value and dignity of black lives. 
I offer my support and solidarity to our black students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends for whom these incidents may have a particularly traumatic impact.
To each of you, I want you to know that we see you, we honor your humanity, and we acknowledge the pain that living while black holds for you in this moment and beyond. I share my own exasperation at being in this place once again.
I offer my support and solidarity to all in our community – those who reside at various intersections of identity as historically underrepresented, people of color, other marginalized identities, as well as those committed to making the world more just. 
I write to name without caveat that what happened to George Floyd was inhumane, immoral, and unjust.
I write to acknowledge the collective trauma and the lack of trust that these incidents trigger, and acknowledge our struggle to deal with such blatant indifference for fellow human beings. The safety and well-being of our campus community is a priority.
I write to ask you to situate the racial violence and the protests that you are witnessing in a broader context – these incidents are not ahistorical. These words from a speech by the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. resonate:
Certain conditions continue to exist in our society, which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention (Martin Luther King, Jr. “The Other America” 1967)

Our willingness to acknowledge the racial terror upon which our country is built and the systemic structural forces that sustain and lock in advantage and disadvantage as a self-reinforcing system that has been operating for years is critical.
I also want to say to those from other backgrounds who may have no lived experiences from which to draw understanding about these devastating events, but who are struggling to make sense of them – that we all have a role to play in listening more to one another, learning about each other and committing to uprooting racism in our personal and professional lives. We cannot change that which we do not know and understand or for which we hold little respect and curiosity. Thus, it is imperative we all learn how to productively engage across difference. We can start by courageously confronting conditions as they are.
Yes, what you see on the videos surrounding all of these tragedies is real and reflects deeply enriched interlocking systems that reproduce racism every day in our society. Yes, it is who we are as a nation. Yes, it does reflect who we are as a society. But it does not have to reflect what we can become, which is where I find hope and strength for the journey toward justice.
As the university’s strategic diversity and equity leader, I unequivocally repudiate any acts of hate, racism, or discrimination, and I will not stop pushing us to accept our imperfection, and to be better for the good of our students and the communities they will impact. 
I will be in touch soon with more thoughts and information on how we together will continue to learn and grow, and focus on how we can be more accountable in our roles for educating the next generation of leaders. What separates us is fear. Please do not give into fear at this time. We need each other more than ever. 
I will end by asking you to be present to every breath you take today and the days to come -- remember Floyd, Arbery, Taylor, and the countless others whose lives have been snuffed out by racism and bigotry. Reflect on your responsibility as a member of our community to co-create a university that is inclusively excellent for all. So that we can honestly and courageously confront the world as it is, in order to create one that is more loving, more just, and more humane. 
Stay safe and be well.

Our SMU community grieves with the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. For many in our University community, these deaths are intensely personal and salt to ancient wounds.

Events underscoring racial and social injustice point to a tear in the fabric of our democracy. As Americans, we have the right to peacefully protest injustice and violations of public trust; therefore, it is important to recognize that this constitutionally protected right is sometimes usurped by those promoting anarchy. In addition, if we live by our words, ""World Changers Shaped Here,"" it is crucial that we remain dedicated to educational, economic, legal, and social programs (such as the Cultural Intelligence Initiative @ SMU) developed to build and enhance communication across cultural, religious and racial divides.

As the University community returns to campus following our ongoing response to COVID-19, it is essential for each of us to be a force for mutual respect and commitment to those with whom we interact every day. Just as we have common responsibilities to those around us in fighting the effects of the virus, we also must visibly share our commitment to fighting racism and violence.

The killing of George Floyd serves as another painful example of the systemic racial disparities present in our country.

Today, we are a nation in mourning—a nation that is experiencing hate, fear, and an unacceptable sense of loss. Our communities of color have endured unequal treatment for far too long. We can vividly see this in the grief and anger over the tragic death of George Floyd, as well as the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on minority communities. Today, we grieve and are saddened by the devastating loss of life, the violence, and the destruction that is impacting communities across our country.

As a community that deeply values diversity, equity, and inclusion, UAlbany stands strong in rejecting racism, hate, and violence, which are diametrically opposed to our core beliefs and values.

However, we are also hopeful and inspired by the acts of kindness that we have seen in these very difficult times. The peaceful protests clamoring for justice; community organizations coming out to provide nourishment to those who suffer food insecurity; people helping local businesses pick up the pieces as a result of so much violence and destruction; the ongoing calls for unity—to address issues of racial, social, and economic disparities. Yes, there is a sense of hope and optimism in the midst of so much tragedy; and there are many opportunities for us all, collectively, to make a positive difference in our communities.

Our UAlbany community must stand as a beacon of hope, and unequivocally demonstrate our longstanding commitment to social and economic justice through our work to address and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in our communities.

During these extraordinarily challenging times, it is more important than ever that we support one another and stand strong as a UAlbany family. I am very proud of our strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. I am also grateful for our response to COVID-19, which has been generous, innovative, and compassionate. And, I am moved by the way Great Danes are speaking out to end racial injustice.

UAlbany will continue to contribute our research and expertise to fight COVID-19, including the racial disparities that have been laid bare by this global pandemic. We will continue reaching out to help people in need in our communities. We will also keep standing up for what is right.

Most of all, I want you to know that I support you and care deeply about your well-being and your success. While we remain physically apart for now, let us join hands in spirit, knowing that together, we will not only get through this—we will create a better world.

Dear members of the Geneseo community, 

While the College does not typically comment on national or international incidents, events of the past week are so unsettling that silence is not an option. The unrest sweeping the nation was prompted by the deeply disturbing circumstances associated with the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. However, it reflects a broader acknowledgement that this loss is one of far too many among persons of color and especially Black individuals in our society. This latest tragedy occurred in Minnesota, but we have seen time and again that racial injustice knows no bounds.

We members of the Geneseo community have chosen to embrace inclusivity as one of our five core values, and it’s essential that we not merely espouse but live that value. I call on each of you to join me in identifying tangible ways in which we can advance our individual - and our collective - commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Examine and check our own privilege. Recognize and call out injustice where it exists. Commit to doing our part to enhance our campus climate and culture. As an educational institution, we have an opportunity to actively effect positive change in our world, and through our resolute efforts, I have every confidence we can contribute to positive and much-needed societal change.

We must continue to build connections, trust, and acceptance as we value and learn from each other, while working to uplift each other. We must practice civility, empathy, and equality while standing against racism. We have the power as an institution of higher learning to make positive changes and demonstrate the tenets of inclusivity and social justice.

We write to you in the midst of tremendous pain, sorrow, anger and concern. From scenes in Minnesota, Georgia, New York and beyond, we have witnessed horrific images reminding us that the sting of racism and systemic injustice is real. 

Each act of discrimination and violence carries with it a significant and sustained impact, especially among those targeted. George Floyd is a visceral and painful reminder of the unique ways many of us—students, faculty, staff and alumni—have experienced discrimination and violence. We are clearly in the midst of troubled times, and while civic and law enforcement authorities bear a particular responsibility, we of Syracuse University are now presented with a collective and crucial opportunity. 

We recognize the hate and terror that continues to infect each and every corner of our country and world. To face such truth requires compassion. We also witness the tremendous goodness found within our diverse campus community, and we fully believe in our capacity to create and sustain our common good. 

The challenges before us might seem impossible to overcome, and we are all far from perfect. Our response must meet the importance of this moment, to build communities where hate and intolerance are not just condemned and rejected, but eliminated. We are now called upon to embody our values and embrace each other. We must choose—through our words, thoughts and deeds—to emerge as a stronger and more just community. 

We grieve for the families who have lost loved ones and for those who are suffering. It is simply not enough to try to imagine what others are going through. We must have the respect and resolve to do something about it. When we engage one another with kindness and compassion, we are working to ensure the dignity and worth of all. 

While distanced around the world, we in the Orange Community can bind together and act together, for the sake of our world.

Dear Horned Frogs,
The events of this past week have filled me with deep sadness. Our black and marginalized
students, faculty and staff are hurting, as are many others in our community. Our campus
community is bewildered, angered, outraged and sorrowful over the tragic death of George
Floyd.
It can be difficult, but not impossible, to discuss issues of race, violence and privilege in
America. We can and must have these important and valuable conversations. We also must
identify and implement solutions. I know many are hurting and while I do not have the
same lived experiences, I will do my part to make our campus community a welcoming
place for all. We will respect, honor and value each person on this campus because
inclusion is a defining hallmark of our culture.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts remain underway, including our work to
integrate DEI into our core curriculum and develop new diversity training for our students,
faculty and staff. We are diversifying and training campus hiring committees to achieve
more diverse candidate pools and a more diverse campus community. We are
implementing TCU R.I.S.E. (Responsible for Inclusion and Sustaining Excellence
Certificate), a program designed to increase campus members’ ability to navigate cultural
conflict and interrupt structural and systemic issues of power, privilege and oppression.
As an institution of higher learning, we have a sacred duty to lift up differences of thought
and opinion. We firmly support freedom of speech for all members of our campus
community. Our mission is to educate individuals to think and act as ethical leaders and
responsible citizens in the global community. When we achieve that mission, it is only
then that we can become a force for the greater good.
I promise to join you in trying to make the world a better place through my own actions.
Each of us has a responsibility to collectively transform our communities and stand
together against racism and violence.
While we are making important changes that will help us improve our community, these
solutions do not stop our pain right now. I see it reflected in the emails, calls and texts I
have received from so many of you as well as our alumni. You are not alone. I love and
care for each of you deeply and today, I join my voice with yours.

The College of New Jersey,,3,3,https://news.tcnj.edu/2020/06/01/standing-together/,"Dear TCNJ Community,

Last week’s death of George Floyd was yet another example of the racism, bigotry, and incivility facing the nation and the members of every community. It follows the deaths of Breonna Taylor in March, Ahmaud Arbery in February and so many others. These losses bring pain and trauma for students, faculty, and staff. As human beings and partners in higher learning we must stand together against the hate and violence demonstrated in this case and so many others.

For too long, too many in our country have turned a blind eye to racism in the hopes that it will simply go away. We cannot continue to ignore this problem. Racism is not just a person of color issue. It is everyone’s issue, which makes it everyone’s responsibility to actively work against it—today and every day.

At TCNJ, we are committed to doing the difficult work necessary to grow and sustain a community where all members are valued and treated equally. This is reflected in the creation in late 2018 of the Division of Equity and Inclusion and the valuable programming and initiatives it sponsors. Its efforts are aimed at promoting action to address issues of hate and bias for the campus and broader community. Please refer to the division’s webpage for updates on programming. We’re planning to launch an anti-hate initiative in the fall that we hope will receive your support and participation.

Though we can’t be together, we challenge all members of the TCNJ community to confront and address racism and hate in your own community, the nation, and the world. We challenge you to find opportunities to share in our common humanity, and treat each other with dignity and respect. These are just a few of the qualities that reflect the values of our strong TCNJ community. We demonstrate these values as a constant reminder that George Floyd’s life and all black lives matter.

In solidarity and with commitment,

The University of Texas at Austin,Big 12,2,2,https://president.utexas.edu/messages-speeches-2020/turbulent-and-difficult-times,"Dear UT Community, 

This isn’t the first letter I’d planned to write as interim President of The University of Texas at Austin. I had a series of welcome messages set to go out today. But they didn’t anticipate or acknowledge the events of the past few days and the pain those events have caused for so many — so I had to start over. 

Today’s transition comes during a turbulent and difficult time. We are experiencing widespread outrage, anger, sadness and reflection here in Austin, throughout Texas and across our country. The senseless killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests have gripped the nation. As I watch these events unfold, I feel for those who are in pain and am acutely aware that we must continue our struggle for meaningful and enduring change to overcome acts of racism and violence that corrode our community.

These challenges come as we are already responding to the COVID-19 crisis, which has become so much more than a life-threatening disease. It has paused or disrupted many of the core elements of our daily lives, forcing students to adjust to learning remotely and a different market for internships and jobs; requiring faculty and staff members to work in new, less comfortable ways; threatening many individuals’ ability to keep their jobs and earn a living; and impacting our health care and education systems.

As we navigate these difficult times, I am reminded of just how critical The University of Texas at Austin is for our community, state, nation and the entire world.

UT has always been a special place to me, as a student, faculty member and dean of the McCombs School of Business. Now more than ever, I see that the creation and dissemination of knowledge are the most effective antidotes for injustice, inequality and intolerance, and for the advancement and improvement of our society. And that’s what we do at UT.

We say, “What starts here changes the world.” Those starts and changes don’t just happen. They are the result of actions — large and small, as individuals and in teams — by our students, faculty, staff and alumni.

Without question, 2020 has not been the year any of us wanted it to be. We have seen political dysfunction, a global pandemic, economic distress, racial tension — and it is only June 1. In facing these struggles and uncertainty, we need people who can think creatively, develop workable solutions and solve difficult problems. The University of Texas has always had a mandate to be a “university of the first class.” Part of that mandate means that this university and the people of this community will take an active role in addressing the critical problems our society is facing.

As Longhorns, when we are tested, we don’t shy away. When we are challenged, we don’t fade into the background and shrink from our responsibility. We come together and draw upon the diverse range of talent, energy and passion that we have on the Forty Acres, to take on the most important and difficult issues of our time. I look forward to working with you to do that in the days and months ahead.

Sincerely yours,

Jay Hartzell

Tufts University,,1,1,https://president.tufts.edu/news/2020/05/31/community-message-on-racial-injustice/,"May 31, 2020 

Dear members of the Tufts University community, 

This spring has been a difficult one for our entire community, as all of our lives have taken turns that were inconceivable just months ago. But it is important to recognize that we have not all been challenged in the same ways. The coronavirus pandemic, with its disproportionate impact on the health and economic status of communities of color, has revealed, once again, the deep disparities that continue to exist in our nation. And the recent acts of violence against Black people demonstrate, once again, the racism and injustice that persist in our society. 

I recognize that I have the privilege of being able to go for a jog or put on a mask without fearing that my skin color will make me a target. Not all members of our society—and our Tufts community—enjoy such privilege. To our Black students, faculty, staff and alumni, please know that I stand with you in demanding these injustices stop. 

As a community, we want to come together, share our pain, and find a way to be a part of the solution. But we are currently separated around the world. I hope we can use our distance as a strength, rather than a barrier. Let’s work to improve the communities in which we find ourselves today and hope that by our actions, we can begin to knit this nation together. 

I hope you will stay safe and support one another during these difficult times.

University of California-Berkeley,PAC-12,5,5,https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/29/a-message-from-campus-leaders-standing-together/,"While we all profoundly feel the suffering and loss related to COVID-19—suffering and loss visited disproportionately on those who are Black, indigenous, people of color, and poor—we are appalled by the racist killings of recent weeks. We write to express our outrage; we stand in steadfast solidarity with our Black community; and we offer heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of the victims of the racially-motivated violence that is taking place in various communities across America. Unchecked violence at the hands of police and civilians requires our – and all of society’s – urgent attention. 

As a campus community, we stand with the family of Ahmaud Arbery, who was murdered while jogging in Georgia by two white men. We stand with Christian Cooper, who was the victim of a woman’s attempt to use the police as a weapon against him while he pursued his passion for birdwatching in New York’s Central Park. We stand with the loved ones of Breonna Taylor, an essential worker during this pandemic who was killed in her home by police. We stand against the senseless killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer who knelt on his neck, while three others watched and assisted, as Mr. Floyd choked out the same final words of another slain Black man, Eric Garner: “I can’t breathe.” 

Let us say their names, acknowledge their humanity, and commit to doing what we can to build a more just society. 

Let us also acknowledge that while these names and incidents made their way into the national news and discourse, they are not by any means isolated, nor is the racism that underlies them. 

According to Rutgers University Sociologist Frank Edwards, one out of every 1,000 Black men in America will be killed by a police officer. This makes them two and half times more likely than white men to die during encounters with officers. 

Less noticed by the mainstream media but equally important to elevate are Black women, gender non-conforming and trans people who have been murdered in recent weeks and months. 

We must call out and hold accountable our broken structures, build bridges that will lead to mutual understanding and respect across differences, and work to create a future in which we can all thrive, especially in these most challenging times. This work must happen across the nation – and it must happen on a local level as well. 

We acknowledge the grief, anger, sadness, helplessness, and outrage that these killings create in our community. Let us channel those feelings toward a commitment to each others’ wellness. If you would like support, please contact UC Berkeley Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). Counselors are available for phone and video counseling appointments.

We must all move forward with a real and practical plan to shift our country’s trajectory: better training for police in de-escalation practices, more transparency and accountability in the discipline of officers who break rules, greater involvement by the Department of Justice with thorough investigations of law enforcement entities, and robust efforts not only to diversify police forces, but also to provide more nuanced, racially sensitive training. 

We must also look to methodical, tangible and inclusive ways to restore and further foster a healthy relationship between law enforcement and the communities of color who depend on officers of the law to model both justice and compassion. 

In our role as educators, researchers, and civic leaders, we must prepare our youth to participate vigorously in civic discourse and democracy. A robust civic discourse requires the truth: The killings must stop. The system must change.",No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,
University of Central Florida,,5,5,https://www.ucf.edu/news/our-future-is-inclusion/,"So many members of our community are hurting right now, shattered by recent deaths that echo the long history of racial injustices that have plagued our country.

As I write this, I realize words are inadequate to address this pain. But I share in the horror of George Floyd’s murder and understand the pain and anger it has sparked.

What is needed now is action — a commitment from our university to not merely celebrate our diversity, but to be actively anti-racist.

Systemic racism, sexism, homophobia and other hateful ideologies seek to deny our shared humanity. They must be called out and confronted. They do not reflect the values of our UCF community.

Learning From Each Other
One way we can take immediate action is to learn from each other.

Because we cannot gather in the traditional way, this Friday from 2 to 3:30 p.m., we will host a virtual conversation about race and unity with the campus community. More information will be shared soon.

Listening to each other’s stories helps each of us learn and grow. We welcome discussions about lived experiences along with suggestions for how we can collectively move forward on our campus.

Educational tools such as the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture’s newly launched “Talking About Race” online portal provide valuable resources for self-reflection.

Still, reflection must be paired with action and a commitment to stand against racism in all its forms. At UCF, hate and bias-related incidents are responded to by the Just Knights Response Team, which serves as a resource for our entire community to help ensure a safe and inclusive UCF experience.

Connections to other campus support networks are provided by UCF’s Office of Social Justice and Advocacy.

Change Starts at UCF
Change starts with each one of us, including leaders across the university who must actively embrace diversity and inclusive excellence in their words and actions, especially in mentoring and hiring. It will take all of us working on critical race issues to build a better UCF.

UCF is not perfect. I want us to demonstrate to the world what can be achieved when more of us work together toward a shared humanity.

Since interviewing to come to UCF, I have said that our university looks like the future of America. Looking like the future of America is a great start but not sufficient. We must be the example for the rest of the country and world for how a community fully commits to inclusive excellence.

Black Lives Matter. You matter.

University of Chicago,,2,2,https://provost.uchicago.edu/announcements/our-community-and-events-minneapolis-and-chicago,"Our nation is confronting painful issues in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and a number of other racially motivated incidents. These recent examples represent a small fraction of the bias and violence that occurs across the U.S. and around the world each day. The deep alarm expressed by people throughout the country, including in our home of Chicago, reflects many decades of grief and anguish over the intractable scourge of racism against minority communities, particularly African Americans. 

I know that many of you are feeling sadness, pain, and anger over these recent events. In these already difficult times, this is an occasion for solidarity and for a strengthened commitment to care for each other and work to improve our community, our city and, our nation. Even though most of us are separated by distance as this quarter comes to a close, our shared values bind us together to seek truth, value diversity, and strive for justice. 

Diversity and inclusion are core values of our institution. We value every member of our campus community, and each of us should show respect for one another. The vitality of the South Side is fundamentally linked with that of the University, and we esteem the deep relationships and partnerships that the residents of the South Side and members of the University community have built together. Fostering a sense of trust, inclusion, belonging and safety for our faculty, other academic appointees, staff, and students is always a priority, and especially so during this time. In the coming days, there will be more information about opportunities for our community to come together in dialogue about these issues. 

We also encourage you to access the many valuable University resources that may be helpful to you right now: 

The Center for Identity + Inclusion engages students and members of our University community from all backgrounds to ensure personal, academic, and professional growth, and success. 
The Center for the Study of Race, Politics, and Culture offers a wide array of programming, including a Zoom series focused on the racial disparities of COVID-19. 
The Pozen Center for Human Rights offers regular programming about global human rights. 
Spiritual Life serves as a destination for religious and spiritual needs. 
UChicago Student Wellness offers counseling services and other support for students impacted by these and other events. 
The Urban Health Initiative runs inclusive community grants and organizes a variety of community programs and services. 
The Diversity & Inclusion website features a listing of related events happening across campus. 

Thank you for the continuing work of people across our University to build a strong, supportive, and inclusive community.

Even though a global pandemic is keeping us apart from each other, I share in your pain, anger and sadness. When we see acts of racism, it affects us deeply and takes a physical, mental and emotional toll. We must reach out and support each other as we process what has happened. For me, I will not lose hope. I take heart in how our students have engaged with us over the last academic year. We had honest conversations in a genuine effort to enhance campus climate together and build a more welcoming, safe and inclusive community for all.

These intolerable injustices, whether they happen in Minnesota, New York or here in Colorado, strike at the core of everything we believe. Let me be clear: I am committed to diversity and inclusion of everyone on our campus. 

We stand in solidarity with all members of our campus community, including our police department and the city of Boulder in encouraging and supporting peaceful demonstrations.

As a campus community, it is incumbent on us to encourage civil discourse that lifts us all from this darkness. Universities can be, and must be, at the heart of social change. As a campus, we continuously work to cultivate a diverse, inclusive and welcoming community. We best illustrate this through our moral actions when we see injustice, close to home or far away.

University of Connecticut,,2,2,https://today.uconn.edu/2020/05/message-uconn-community/,"Dear UConn Community,

Recent events have called national attention yet again to the destructive power of prejudice and racism. The death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis serves as our most recent example. We are disgusted by the images we have seen capturing the unconscionable acts that caused his death. Demonstrations across the country make clear that communities are hurting and frustrated by repeated acts of violence against their neighbors, friends, and families. These events have saddened and angered so many on a deeply personal level, with the burden of fear for one’s own and their family’s safety placed squarely upon African-Americans.

Unfortunately, this is just one of many examples of the pain caused by systemic injustices that are present every day. Take, for example, the disproportionate rates of death by COVID-19 among African-American, Latinx, and Indigenous peoples, or the discriminatory acts targeting individuals of Asian descent and foreign nationals from many countries in this pandemic. This adds to the already vulnerable experience of so many in our community, including but not limited to DACA students who are unsure about their future; individuals with disabilities who can feel invisible; LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing verbal and physical acts of violence; individuals subjected to intolerance based on their religious identity and beliefs; and people of color who are forced to constantly question if they can engage safely in routine activities like jogging or bird watching.

These events underscore the critical importance of our infusing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in everything we do every single day. Not with mantra and platitudes, but with clearly articulated and tangible action that is supported by the University with budget and action. As scholars, educators, and colleagues, we are uniquely positioned to reflect, learn, and act.

We are committed to this work as UConn moves forward from some of its own recent struggles. We have a crucial new partner in these efforts with the recent hire of Dr. Frank Tuitt as our new Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer. We are all eager to work with him to sustain a culture that understands, respects, and appreciates differences, but also one that readily acknowledges our shortcomings and holds ourselves accountable for measurable progress at all times.

As he looks ahead to this new role, Frank shared the following: “I strongly believe that institutions like UConn should be at the center of creating spaces for students, faculty, and staff to imagine and invent ways to build more inclusive, affirming, and equitable institutions, organizations, and communities, and I look forward to doing my part to contribute to that collective effort.”

We have communicated closely with him over the past several days, and we all will benefit from his leadership and expertise.

We have the opportunity to engage our entire community in the work that is needed, building upon continued advocacy and efforts of concerned faculty, staff, and administrators at UConn in collaboration with our cultural centers and our amazing undergraduate and graduate students who are willing to speak clearly and directly about their experiences. Change cannot be carried out by one person or one office alone. Too often the labor of this work is disproportionately undertaken by our most vulnerable, impacting their career progression, as well as their mental health and overall satisfaction with their work experience. This is a time when we can build momentum to share the responsibility across our entire community at our Storrs, UConn Health, Avery Point, Hartford, Stamford, Waterbury, and law school campuses.

We also have been extremely fortunate to benefit from the stewardship of Interim Chief Diversity Officer Dana Wilder. Building on strengths of the Office for Diversity and Inclusion, we are positioned as a national leader and a place where people of all identities feel they have a genuine opportunity for success and belonging. We encourage each of you to explore their website, which includes multiple resources including trainings and guides as well as information on events and cultural centers sponsored by their office.

There are no simple solutions or easy answers to solve the issues of injustice and prejudice in society and at our University. Of all of the various parts of our experience as administrators, this is the one area where we both feel like we have not done enough or met our own expectations. We do not experience that feeling as despair, but instead as a motivator to understand and accept our own privilege and the responsibilities that it brings to do more. We encourage our community to hold our entire leadership team accountable as we carry out that vital work together.

The challenge now is to remember this moment even if it fades from the headlines and to continue to strive for a society and a UConn that allows all to live safely and welcomed.

University of Kansas,Big 12,5,5,https://chancellor.ku.edu/news/2020/jun2,"Dear Students, Colleagues and Members of the KU Lawrence and Edwards Community:

We, the Chancellor and Provost of the University of Kansas, are emerging, as many of you are, from a week of heart wrenching conversations about the toxic impact that racism has on all of our communities. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and David McAtee, and the exchange between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper in Central Park, are just recent and high-profile additions to innumerable immoral acts of racism to Black members of our communities.

The protests across the country, in the region, and in our cities over the past week and in Lawrence Sunday night are powerful statements of the depth of pain and anger that so many of our students, colleagues and friends are feeling. We have done a lot of listening over the past several days, and we recognize the disappointment that our earlier messages created. We hear our community members when you tell us you are broken-hearted and exhausted, and that it’s too much to bear.

We know that acts of racism and discrimination, in their many forms, happen in Lawrence and at KU, and on a regular basis. We are not free of the causes of this period of protest and unrest.

The egregious acts of racism and discrimination that have been targeted toward our Black community members do not stand in isolation. Members of Asian, LatinX, Muslim, immigrant and LGBTQIA communities are also targets of hate speech, discrimination, and racialized violence. Our community members who have disabilities and those who experience challenges with mental health are often stigmatized, abandoned, and suffer in silence. Members of our Black and Native communities have been disproportionately devastated by COVID-19, which is another fatal reminder of the systemic disparities in health outcomes, availability of financial support, and educational resources for so many of our most vulnerable community members.

Our hearts break with yours. We stand with you and for you.

It’s long past time for racism and discrimination to end. If we are to be on the side of social justice, we — meaning, we as leaders, KU as an institution, and each of us as community members — simply must do the work.

We all need KU to be a place that doesn’t replicate, tolerate or perpetuate racism, systematically, systemically, or individually. We know you are anxiously waiting and hoping that we can get past talking and hollow promises, and do something together in a different way that begins to make things better. You want us to hold ourselves to a higher standard, and we are ready to step up, to take responsibility, and to place KU at the forefront of social change.

In consultation and collaboration with leaders of our communities of color and marginalized groups, we begin today to engage in actions that move us to change:

We will convene the leaders of our campus police, the City of Lawrence Police Department, the City Manager and the Mayor to discuss policing strategies that reinforce respectful and community-engaged policing, and to re-emphasize comprehensive police training that does not permit the kinds of acts that led to the death of George Floyd and so many others.
We will bring together the leaders of our diversity councils to establish a university-level advisory council for equity and inclusion and commit to regular and continued outreach.
We will charge leaders across campus to participate in training that will allow us to begin the work of facilitating intergroup dialogues that bring together representatives of agent groups and target groups to open up difficult conversations.
We will partner with leaders in higher education and in the public and private sectors across the Greater Kansas City Region to engage in initiatives that immediately begin to address root causes in key areas that impact racial violence.
We will ensure that improving equity, diversity and inclusion is explicitly stated as a goal for each team in our COVID-19 Design Challenge and in the longer term, in all of our Jayhawks Rising strategic doing activities.
As always, we want to hear from you, and we want you to know the resources the University has available to support you:

Office of Diversity & Equity | 785-864-4904 or diversity@ku.edu
University Ombuds Office | 785-864-7261 or ombuds@ku.edu

University of Delaware,,2,2,https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2020/may/president-dennis-assanis-letter/,"Dear UD Community,

In the past several days, some deeply disturbing incidents in our nation have reminded us all that racism, discrimination and injustice continue to challenge our society, even as we strive to make our communities more diverse and inclusive. The deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky — as well as other incidents of violence and prejudice — are tragic and disheartening.

The University of Delaware unequivocally condemns violence and the racism that fuels it. These incidents stand in stark contrast to our institutional values of diversity, inclusion and respect for others, which are essential to our academic mission of educating global citizens who are dedicated to building a better world.

While such words are important and necessary to say, the real work of creating a more just society falls on each of us, every day and wherever we may be. The coronavirus pandemic has forced us all to be physically distant from one another, away from campus and often limited to our homes and neighborhoods. Yet we remain the University of Delaware community — strong and caring and committed to serving the needs of those around us. As our spring semester draws to a close and we embark on whatever summer plans await us, let us recommit ourselves to living out these values in our daily lives.

University of Florida,SEC,5,5,https://www.facebook.com/notes/dean-onye-ozuzu/from-the-desk-of-the-dean/545462856358280/,"Dear students, faculty, staff, and all: 
I am a black woman, a mother of three children. My youngest, named for his grandfather, is as tall as me. He is 11 years old. One of the many reasons (personal and professional) that I accepted the invitation to join the UF College of the Arts as its Dean was that I could see that he would be as tall as a man, long before he had time to become one. The informal calculus of age, height, population density, modes of public transportation (and so on), and number of times and how soon when (not if) he would end up in a potentially life-threatening engagement with law enforcement; this informal calculus predominates my negotiations with my lived experience. This is an everyday primary concern in a place where I imagine others (who live a different experience of life in the United States) might be predominantly concerned with a “normalcy” I cannot imagine. 
So given that, and against the backdrop of yet more public and senseless killings of black people at the hands of police, against the backdrop of our exhausted, angry, divided, and rioting nation, and against the backdrop of an ongoing global pandemic that is also killing black people at disproportionate rates—I search for the will and the words to address the college. I echo Killer Mike in his speech two days ago in Atlanta, “I didn’t want to come, and I don’t want to be here… but I am duty-bound to be here.” WE are all duty bound by the struggles our ancestors made to free this very campus we work on, and the city we live in from their legacies in relationship to slave ownership, Jim Crow laws, lynching and all the many organized systems of racial oppression embedded in the foundation of our society; we are all duty bound to pick up our heavy and grieving selves and get to work. I reach out to you today as a black woman, a mother of three, and the Dean of the College of the Arts and say we must, urgently, right now, get to work on CHANGE. 
In the fall of 2018 when I first joined the UF community as the Dean of the College of the Arts we worked together as staff, faculty and administrators to craft a statement that would guide the hiring of all of our new faculty positions. In that statement we asserted that we are a place that “intends to be a transformative community, responding to and generating paradigmatic shifts in the arts and beyond.” We called for new colleagues who “identify as a change-makers.” We actively sought to hire colleagues “who will prepare students to access and unsettle centers of power in a radically changing world,” in order to “position emerging artists and researchers as catalysts for equity on local and global levels.” At that writing, like any document written collaboratively by well over one hundred people, there was ample debate. Questions about its unapologetically active push towards artists seeing and saying what impact we intend to make in the world rose up. I trust that the rationale for urgency in our call to action is now crystal clear for us all. For many of us it was and has been clear for some time, for some of us generations, centuries. For those newly awakened to the reality that racism is a pre-existing condition that is making us all susceptible to the unraveling of our nation: Welcome, we’ve needed you. 
As artists, arts educators, researchers, and scholars, we are powerful members of the ecosystems that shape, disseminate, engage people in, and change culture. We influence, reflect, and critique how life is embodied, seen, processed, and shared. And as artists in the privileged halls of the academy, we curate which cultures, and what aspects of those cultures are venerated, sustained and valued by a state funded institution. We also get to decide if and when and where we open ourselves up to being challenged and to learning when members of our student bodies, our communities, or when our colleagues say, “you are not seeing us, you are not hearing us, we matter.” We, as people with the privilege to be multiple kinds of influential gate-keepers, need to be thinking about the cultural milieu of the police officer that knelt on George Floyd’s neck and the officers that stood and watched, and the clerk that called the police, and the person that took the call, and the one that dispatched the call. We need to be thinking about how what we do relates to the culture that shaped each of their perceptions of reality, how they perceive themselves and others, how they perceive black people in the context of humanity. What is present in the way that we as artists and educators are shaping the world that should be removed because it contributes to racism? What is absent that should be included? How might artists contribute to racism? How could the arts contribute to undoing racism? And if we have no ideas in answer to those questions, what do we need to read, to watch, to think about, to learn, so that we start having some… now? 
In this profoundly challenging moment, I can honestly say that I am encouraged to be working with the faculty, staff and students in a college that wrote that statement, our “Meta-Narrative,” last year. I am encouraged by the presence of the faculty that we recruited and welcomed with the statement as our guide. I am encouraged to be participating in the finalization of the year-long process of developing our new strategic plan, our “Meta-Strategy,” that will articulate and map our methods for becoming and being a transformative, responsive, catalytic community that contributes to the crafting of a new, better world. And I am encouraged that I am dean of a college where I can say—let’s take a collective deep breath with awareness that it is precious and not guaranteed to all equally, let’s take care of one another, let’s pay attention to keeping our hearts and minds restoring and strong, and let’s get BACK to work. The future is now.

May 30, 2020 11:19 AM

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,

We, along with so many, are struggling to fully comprehend the systemic violence and the actions of members of the Minneapolis Police Department that resulted in the death of George Floyd this week. This is the home of one of the members of our Big Ten university family and our thoughts are with our colleagues and the broader Minneapolis-St. Paul community today.

And while George Floyd is who we see and mourn this week, we have also witnessed the senseless deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor this spring.

We stand in the middle of a global health crisis that will claim hundreds of thousands of lives and burden millions of others for a generation to come. These are days when the health of our communities depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another. This is when we most need to come together.

It is painful to watch streets filled with more anger and more violence sparked by divisive sources of hatred that our nation seems unable to set aside even when we are all threatened by this virus that does not discriminate in choosing who it harms.

For some of us, this is very, very personal. But the grief, sadness and loss is profound and universal.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a community committed to the scholarship, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership that dismantles systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise, diminish and destroy.

And unfortunately, this same pandemic that has disrupted so much, also prevents us from coming together physically here at Illinois. We are not able to help each other process what we are seeing and what we are feeling in the way we would wish. So, today, when we cannot raise our voices together, we want to share this message in the hope that it will remind everyone that we do not have to remain silent alone. 

George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. We can say their names and we can help ensure that they are not allowed to be forgotten.

The anger, sadness, and fear felt by our community, and specifically Black communities across our nation, over the killing of George Floyd are justified. This is not a new phenomenon and the Black community is, we are sure, exhausted from the constant trauma and pain of being the recipients of mistreatment by those who are tasked with serving and protecting communities—the police.

There is also disappointment, frustration, and pain due to the continued disproportionate police brutality against people of color, specifically the Black community. These inequalities manifest themselves economically and socially. No one should feel their race or any aspect of their identity makes them a target for violence. Addressing inequality requires changing hearts, minds, and systems, and the University of Iowa will continue to work toward that goal through actions. To that end, we will release an update to our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Plan, which our community has developed, this coming week.

Over the past several days, the images from across our nation are difficult to comprehend and elicit a range of feelings. While we will engage with these emotions individually, and on our own timeline, one thing is clear—together we must act. Each of us must lead change within our individual communities to actively disrupt racism (interpersonal, systemic, and societal).

As you know, on our campus and within our community:

We will not tolerate anything but a safe and inclusive campus for people of all backgrounds regardless of race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, ancestry, or disability.
We value the First Amendment and freedom of expression and believe civil discourse and the respectful exchange of ideas are the cornerstones of higher education and this great institution.
We are here to help. Many resources are available and we encourage you to reach out and ask for help.

This pandemic has surfaced many truths about our society. In many cases, it has highlighted the goodwill and caring community found across this country as individuals have banded together to help address the growing need created by the global public health crisis. In many other cases, however, it has shown us the glaring disparate impacts of Covid-19 on communities of color due to longstanding health and structural inequities, legacies of slavery and racism we grapple with still today.

In the last four months, we have come to know the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and most recently George Floyd. Ms. Taylor is from our very own Louisville community. Whatever your perspective on the specifics of each case, I hope we can agree that these three lives being taken from us so soon is devastating.

At the University of Louisville, Diversity and Inclusion is one of our core Cardinal Principles. This university strives to be a home and safe haven for our students, faculty and staff of color just as we strive to do this for all of the many rich and diverse identities held throughout our campus community. I believe that in many cases we succeed in helping people survive and thrive, but I am also certain that in numerous cases the same expressions of hate and exclusion that daily impact people of color and vulnerable communities outside the campus affect our Cardinal Family right here in our own backyard.

To our students, staff and faculty of color – I see you. I hear you.

Given these tragic incidents and mounting tension building in our own city and across the country, I know many of you are in deep pain having to confront these inequities, sometimes on a daily basis. Please know that I am here to support you, this university is here to support you and we will continue our endeavor to provide an environment where everyone can thrive. 

I want to highlight some of the actions taken recently and others we will soon take to ensure we fully live out our commitment to being a Community of Care that values Diversity and Inclusion:

The Campus Environment Team is in the process of revamping the Bias Incident Response Team to better equip the university to support our constituents, track its occurrence, and implement strategies to counteract incidences of bias, microaggression and racism.
The University of Louisville Police Department’s primary mission is to focus on providing a safe campus community, which includes supporting diversity and equity within the department and on campus. The Department continues to be actively involved in open forums discussing critical racial issues that impact our campus and local community.
The Office of Diversity and Equity, the HSC Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and all affiliated offices are enhancing programming related to structural racism, and reaching out to support those experiencing pain and isolation as well as those who want to learn more and work to change inequitable structures.
The Department of Education Leadership, Evaluation and Organizational Development in the College of Education and Human Development, in collaboration with the Office of Diversity and Equity, are developing an educational series for faculty and staff on topics related to diversity and inclusion.
We have made available a curated list of resources on the Diversity and Equity site for the campus community to engage with to learn more about the historical legacy of slavery and racism in America.
These actions represent some progress, but they are not the solution. The thing that will ultimately change these unfair systems that continue to disproportionately harm people of color, particularly black people, is for each of us to learn more, to understand how we contribute, both knowingly and unknowingly, to these systems and to actively work to change them. I too am committing to learn more, to take real actions to make a difference, to be better and to do more.

The frustration and anger that has led to protests here and across the country is understandable. Each of us must choose how to take meaningful action to improve the society we live in. Take care of yourself and take care of each other. This is what our Cardinal Principle of Community of Care requires of each of us.

It will take all of us acting collectively with informed intention and empowering care to start to see the change we need. I ask each of us to please take an intentional step today to be better and to do more. I need your help. Our Cardinal Family of color needs your help. Our society needs your help.

Sincerely,

On Wednesday morning, May 26, 2020, I woke up to go through my normal daily routine of getting prepared for the workday. But even before I could start my morning walk with my dog, my cellphone was already vibrating with texts and emails about something that had happened the evening before. Many colleagues, family members and friends had sent me links to the now-infamous video of yet another black man losing his life at the hands of law enforcement. This time, for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

I took a moment to click on the links and watch the more than nine-minute video of the last breath being sucked out of the body of Mr. George Floyd. As a black man, I screamed words that I cannot repeat here. As a father, I started to reflect on the safety of my son and daughter and on all the diverse communities who are negatively impacted by acts of injustice. I asked myself, what is wrong with our country when these incidents continue to happen time and time again?

In recent weeks we have again witnessed senseless acts of violence perpetrated against the black community. The tragic loss of lives—those of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and before that, the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and Sean Reed—due to racial violence is deeply saddening and a stain against the values that we personally hold, and that the University of Maryland, as an institution, cherishes.

The fact that these horrific acts have occurred in the midst of a pandemic is a double blow to black and brown communities. They cause additional pain and grief at a time when we are dealing with so many other challenges. But the shameful reality is that the virus has disproportionately affected communities of color. It has exposed the base inequities of our health care system and made painfully clear how those who have suffered so many other injustices for so long must also unequally bear the burden of this disease. These additional acts of racism and hatred bring into greater focus the injustices occurring in our nation.

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., once said that:

""The ultimate measure of a man is not where one stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where one stands in times of challenge and controversy.""

As a university community, we must not accept these latest incidents as inconsequential. We all must rise up and stand together to show our humanity to one another. We must remind ourselves of Dr. King’s words that ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Finally, we must heed the words of the late President John F. Kennedy, ""what unites us is greater than what divides us.""

Even though we are physically separated, now is the time to stand in solidarity and unite against any injustice.

University of Massachusetts-Amherst,,5,5,https://www.umass.edu/spp/news/message-spp-community-director-alasdair-roberts,"Dear Campus Community,

It is with a heavy heart that I write to you today. 

As we cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and what has been described repeatedly as an unprecedented situation, we are confronted with the latest in a long line of deeply troubling acts of racial violence for which, sadly, there is an overabundance of precedent.

The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer is emblematic of the institutional racism that is pervasive in our society. Mr. Floyd’s death, along with that of Ahmaud Arbery at the hands of a father and son in Georgia, and the killing of Breonna Taylor by police in her Louisville, Kentucky, home, reveal a malignancy in our society that must be acknowledged and rooted out. How can it be in 21st century America that a black man cannot even engage in the act of birdwatching in Central Park without facing the threat that his mere presence would result in a call to police? It is chilling to think how close Christian Cooper could have come to joining the ranks of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and so many others before them.

This week’s events in Minneapolis remind us just how far our country is from achieving anything close to equity and justice for all. We live in a time when intolerance, bigotry and xenophobia have become mainstream, even at the highest levels of our government. That is why it is so important that we stand united and reject racism and bigotry in all its forms. Although we acknowledge that our community is far from perfect, we must always strive to be better, to foster a community that is grounded in the concept of dignity and respect for all.

Today our city—like many others across the United States—is gripped with outrage at injustice, and with violence. We are summoned in this moment to reinforce our fundamental values, to call upon our resilience, and to be a force for healing the deep societal wounds that the death of George Floyd has torn open once more.

Healing requires more than merely treating symptoms. Yes, we must do everything we can to address all instances of racial discrimination and abuse of power. Yet, we must look more deeply. We must ask the hard questions and be bold enough to take action on the answers we find. We must be willing to look at the root causes of suffering and never make excuses for those who dismiss or defend abuse.

In the wake of COVID-19, I have beckoned us to build a better normal. A better normal cannot exist if the forces that tear us apart go unchecked. In fact, the coronavirus pandemic has brought to light the structural inequalities that result in worse outcomes for people of color with respect both to health and to economic hardship. At the same time, we have witnessed enormous expressions of solidarity, service, and sacrifice—particularly on the part of frontline workers—with people from all walks of life doing whatever is necessary to take care of each other.

As incensed as we all are at the appalling acts that have led to protests here in Miami and elsewhere, and as profoundly wounded as we must acknowledge communities of color feel at yet another Black life lost, I believe we at the U can take those emotions and turn them into a catalyst for change. That is what we do. We are more than just resilient. We are fierce. We are innovative. We are compassionate. And we strive to be exemplary.

We can, and we will, do what we do best. We will bring people of vastly different backgrounds together. We will listen to new ideas and let the pursuit of truth through scholarship and science enlighten the path towards purposeful action. We will analyze what leads to crises and protests, and relentlessly act to address their causes.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many changes to the way we live and interact, one of which is more time with our families. On this Sunday, I encourage you to use that time to do more than watch the struggles that continue to grip our world. Consider the actions you can take—as an individual, as a member of our community, and as an ally to those who continue to be mistreated.

One of our responsibilities as an institution of higher education is to shape the world in which we live. That is our duty collectively and individually. Our mission compels us to be active on all fronts to defeat ignorance, hatred, and oppression. We research solutions to social injustice from every disciplinary perspective. We deliberately provide access to education to those traditionally underrepresented in universities. We engage in service, expanding outreach to every part of our community, particularly on the health care front.

As a university, we have a platform, and we are committed to using it. Our call for the reforms necessary to right systemic wrongs must be unequivocal.

In the coming weeks, we will host a virtual community conversation to outline the next steps we must take. Lives lost deserve it. Our values require it. Let us renew our commitment to living a culture of belonging—one that promotes diversity, inclusion, and equity as the pillars to assure that all persons enjoy the same opportunity to develop their full capabilities.

It is a sad paradox that at a time when we have seen some of the best of humankind in response to the pandemic, we continue to witness injustice. To those feeling hopeless, horrified, and hurt: we stand with you. As distraught as we all might be, I know that the U will never tire of doing our part in the never-ending quest for a better world.

University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,Big 10,7,7,https://umdearborn.edu/about/leadership/office-chancellor/speeches-commentary-and-messages/reaching-out-time-crisis-june-1-2020,"Dear Students and Colleagues, 

Amidst the ongoing tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic, the recent months have also brought pain and shock from the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. This senseless loss of life has come under the guise of public safety, but we know these instances of aggression are merely part of the long history of violence against African Americans. 

From the fear and indignities suffered by people of color in everyday life, such as the one recently experienced by an African American bird watcher in Central Park, to the physical mistreatment and environmental destruction of black communities across the country, racism is a scourge on our country and cannot be abided. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis has sparked spontaneous protests across the country—and the world—against police misconduct and brutality. These protests are a rightful call to end unwarranted and unlawful violence perpetrated by those sworn to protect us and our community. 

Although the overwhelming majority of protestors, in the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., have shown a commitment to peace as they advocate for change, a smaller group has rampaged through a number of our cities inciting violence and damaging property. This is alarming, and for many in our community, brings back terrible memories of destruction and division from our region’s past. We are witnessing yet again how violence begets violence, but as history has borne witness, such actions lead only to long lasting suffering and trauma. 

The cycle of violence must be broken. Our opportunity for a peaceful and just society lies in the hard work of change being done today. We have already seen this work take place. At demonstrations throughout the nation, including Michigan, police officers have taken a knee or marched in solidarity with those demanding change. This acknowledgment of the need for reform is a welcome first sign of what we all hope will be a more equitable future. 

Our university is helping to design a positive way forward. As part of our commitment to producing a more just and equitable society, the university created a program in 2017 to help reimagine the use of force within local police departments. Alternatives to Violent Force is a program designed to guide police officers in thinking differently about how they handle confrontations. The goal of the program is to end the “Us vs. Them” mindset and has been adopted and praised by leaders of law enforcement throughout our region. 

We at the University of Michigan-Dearborn stand together for justice, inclusion, and peace. In that spirit, I have asked my chief of staff, Keisha Blevins, Dean Ann Lampkin-Williams, and my strategic planning co-chair, Deborah Smith Pollard to assemble a working group to strengthen our awareness and amplify our commitment to respect, inclusion and diversity. We remain devoted to our mission of serving our students and the public good, and that commitment will see us through these difficult times. 

I encourage anyone who needs support to access our university’s resources. Students can find help through CAPS, the university’s counseling and psychological services. Faculty and staff can access these services through the Faculty and Staff Counseling and Consultation Office website. 

With sincere hope for a healthy, peaceful and just tomorrow,

University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,,3,3,https://kttc.com/2020/05/27/university-of-minnesota-limiting-involvement-with-minneapolis-police-department/,"Dear students, faculty, and staff,

Our hearts are broken after watching the appalling video capturing the actions of Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officers against George Floyd leading to his tragic death. As a community, we are outraged and grief-stricken. I do not have the words to fully express my pain and anger and I know that many in our community share those feelings, but also fear for their own safety. This will not stand.

Today I am announcing two immediate changes regarding our relationship with MPD.

First, I have directed Senior Vice President Brian Burnett to no longer contract with the Minneapolis Police Department for additional law enforcement support needed for large events, such as football games, concerts, and ceremonies.

Second, I have directed University Police Chief Matt Clark to no longer use the Minneapolis Police Department when specialized services are needed for University events, such as K-9 Explosive detection units.

We have a responsibility to uphold our values and a duty to honor them. We will limit our collaboration with the MPD to joint patrols and investigations that directly enhance the safety of our community or that allow us to investigate and apprehend those who put our students, faculty, and staff at risk.

I write to you to express our overwhelming sadness, and our demands for accountability and justice. Our campuses and facilities are a part of the communities in which they reside. University students, staff, and faculty are day-to-day participants in the life of every community in this state, and we must act when our neighbors are harmed and in pain.

My heart is heavy and my thoughts are with the loved ones and friends of George Floyd.

The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor have evoked much anger, horror and disbelief. The confluence of events in recent weeks continue to tear apart the fabric of our country and impact our campus.

I am struck with profound sadness for the recurring cycle of tragic and senseless deaths, for the African-American and other minority members of our university community who are fearful, anxious and frustrated by the lack of real and sustained change, and for towns and cities across America that are experiencing violence and chaos. I stand with you in declaring that hate, prejudice and racism do not have a place on our campus or in our society.

We all recognize that this University has a difficult history with these issues that oftentimes places us at the forefront of complex and emotional discussions. We will not let our past stop us from working to make a better present and future for everyone on this campus. We must all be active participants on the journey of seeking solutions and inspiring the healing process.

This is a time for change. For me, that means moving the monument away from the center of our campus. That monument has divided this campus, and the process of its removal from the Circle is one I am committed to seeing through to completion. There is more to do, but this needs to happen.

Even as we continue to be separated physically because of the pandemic, there are many ways in which we can stay connected and support one another. Should you need additional support, please utilize the resources available to you as a member of our university community.
I pray for our university community as we work to move our world forward.

Ninety-nine years ago today, blood began to flow down Black Wall Street and the Tulsa Race Massacre ensued, marking one of the most tragic events in the history of our state and nation. And now, nearly a century later, we continue to live with the same violence and vitriol. The recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd are stark examples of black lives lost due to senseless brutality. We know that racism in all of its forms, explicit and implicit, is never more unfair than when it leads to the needless loss of a life. To become the country we know we can be, we must honestly address the issues that underlie these societal divisions and make real, systemic change.

Dear University of Oregon community,

George Floyd’s tragic and senseless killing by a white police officer on a street in Minneapolis shocks, saddens and outrages all of us. Coming in close succession to the apparent murder of Ahmaud Arbery as he jogged in Georgia, six years after Eric Garner met a similar fate on the streets of Staten Island, and after so many others who have lost their lives, we mourn not just for the families of the victims but the ideals of our nation.

As leaders of this university it is important to speak out against these and other less publicized atrocities inflicted against people of color in our nation. We call on our entire university community and nation to recognize that these are not isolated events, but instead reflect a society deeply in need of transformation and healing. Now is the time to raise our voices and send the message that hatred and violence toward people of color and other marginalized groups must stop. In the words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “the ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.”

If we were together in Eugene at this moment, we might collectively mourn Floyd’s death with a march on Johnson Hall or a vigil outside the EMU. But COVID-19 has made coming together as a community in solidarity difficult. Indeed, COVID-19 itself has laid bare, as if we needed more proof, the racial and socio-economic divisions that continue to plague our nation and society. Black, brown, Native Americans, and the poor are getting sick and dying at far greater rates due to deplorable inequities in our health system and the fact that they disproportionately find themselves in frontline jobs that put them at risk. That is unacceptable.

The question is what do we do with our feelings of rage? As leaders of one of America’s great research universities, the answer lies in our own backyard—education, research and leadership. We must continue to reach out and enroll a diverse student body and make sure that ALL students succeed, regardless of race, religion, ethnic origin, socio-economic background, gender identity, or sexual orientation. We must provide students with the tools to dismantle racism, to lead with empathy, and to be animated by the truth that Black lives—like all other lives—not only matter but are sacred. As we move through the months of COVID-19, we understand that many of our Black, Native, Latinx, and Asian students are most vulnerable. We must work hard to retain all of our students, see them through to graduation, and launch them into successful lives. Equity means that different groups will need different tools to succeed, and we will provide that help.

We will also continue the work that we began five years ago on inclusion, which included adding to our multicultural curricula, celebrating different heritages on campus, removing vestiges of oppression, and building a new Black cultural center. And, we fully recognize that we have much, much more to do here. We claim no victories, only an ever-increasing commitment to engage in the work, to persist in lifting the arc so that it continues to bend toward justice.

Finally, our university also has an important role to play in furthering the debate about racial equity through research, teaching, and outreach. This year’s African American Speaker and Workshop Series will focus on disproportionality and resilience of the African American community in the face of COVID-19. Additionally, over the summer and early fall, we will reach out to interested faculty, staff, and students about putting together a series of forums and potentially a course dedicated to examining structural barriers to racial equity in the COVID-19 era. In our own way, we will make sure that these senseless and outrageous deaths do not go unanswered.

The repeated incidents of black lives being treated with reckless abandon are deeply disturbing, saddening, infuriating, and incomprehensible. 

The most recent tragedies involving Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd are painful reminders that police brutality and racism are deadly and cannot be tolerated if we value the lives and well-being of people of color. Now is not a time to remain silent. 

Student Affairs is committed to protecting and supporting the well-being of all our students, and we proudly stand in solidarity with them. Our students rightly demand justice when crimes have been committed. And while the responsibility for investigating and holding wrongdoers accountable does not lie with us, it is our responsibility to advocate for justice in society and engage in meaningful efforts to dismantle racism and other forms of hate.

Taken in context with the recent killings of Breonna Taylor (by police in her own home) and Ahmaud Arbery (by neighbors while jogging), our black community members, in particular, are outraged, traumatized, fearful and in profound pain. 

Grief and concern in their purest forms have been made even more poignant during this time of great uncertainty due to the global public health crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has magnified the long history of racism in our country, ongoing inequity, and the status quo of the dehumanization of our fellow Black Americans. 

How do we react? What do we do? Where do we start? 
We begin by extending our sincere, heartfelt sympathies to the loved ones of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. We join in mourning their unspeakably tragic and untimely deaths. We stand in solidarity with our black family, friends and neighbors in their time of need and help them shoulder their everyday lives so that they have the necessary time to mourn and process the deeper meanings of these losses. And most importantly, no matter how painful, difficult or uncomfortable, we must review these events with full transparency and recognize there are systemic problems in our society that desperately need our attention, time and energy to remedy. 

We must recognize the violation of human rights and the devastating effects that systemic racism, oppression and violence have on the safety, security and health of communities of color. We cannot let these acts be normalized or allow ourselves to become numb to them. The University of California San Diego unequivocally condemns the disproportionate use of excessive force by some police in communities of color. 

We also denounce vigilante acts that terrorize members of the community based upon race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, disability, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation. We as a community must not and will not tolerate acts of hate, bias or violence. We are committed to doing what can be done within our institution to make sure everyone feels that they belong and that they matter. This should be our commitment to ourselves and to each other. 

Where do we go from here? 
In the coming weeks, our Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion has planned community conversations to provide spaces for healing and identifying ways to be agents of change in this moment. Details are forthcoming and will be communicated via campus notice. 

We know that statements such as these do not resolve the intractable issues we face as a country. We know it does not even begin to heal the hurt and trauma caused by structural and systemic racism and discrimination. Collectively, let us continue to work together for a more just, equitable and humane society in our service, activism, pedagogy, and community and collaborative efforts.

University of San Francisco,,5,5,https://myusf.usfca.edu/announcement/addressing-violence-racism-our-country-has-experienced-recently,"Dear USF Community,

I have been struggling to find the words to address the horrifically evil events that have taken place in our country this week and over the past month.

How to understand the death of George Floyd at the hands of four police officers on a Minneapolis street? How to understand the inhumanity of Amy Cooper and the noble humanity of Christian Cooper in the confrontation in Central Park? 

What makes these events even more overwhelming are the many other violent events our country has experienced recently, including the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky; of Steven Taylor in San Leandro, Sean Reed in Indianapolis, Tony McDade in Tallahassee, and Adrian Medearis in Houston. And this is in addition to the terrible toll COVID-19 is taking on communities of color. These events and the underlying racism are not simply unacceptable; they are tearing the fabric of our society. 

I write to our entire university community, with a special word of care for our Black-identified students and colleagues, and with a request: let us pray for each other, cherish each other, stand up for each other, and change the world for the better for each other. I know that I cannot put off the privileges of my particular identity, but I can ask for the grace to have empathy and compassion, and to live in solidarity with all who rightfully are frightened, exposed, and traumatized. As our country faces the reality of the alarming rise of anti-Asian xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-Black violence during the pandemic, as members of the USF community, we are invited to contrast these social ills with our values: our Jesuit mission of solidarity with the oppressed and hope for the common good.

Normally I would ask that we come together in vigils, marches, and rallies to support one another with palpable care. The shelter-in-place order prevents these demonstrations of solidarity. So, we must make other plans, beginning on Wednesday, June 3, from 12 to 1:15 p.m., when we will come together for a virtual vigil for racial justice and reconciliation. You can RSVP here. And of course, CAPS, CASA, faculty advisers, mentors, student leaders, and peer supporters are reaching out and stepping up. Thank you for enacting our shared identity.

In these difficult days, I invite us all to use our privileges — especially our educated minds, our loving hearts, and our stiff backbones to combat racism. I believe that the larger social role of a Jesuit university today is more important, and more promising, than ever. We are a contrast society, a city on a hill, a light to the nations. As change agents, let us take some important actions.

Reach out and communicate with your family, friends, and university companions.
I know that many of you have reached out to your circle already. I’ve heard from many people this week that they are looking to their friends and colleagues to provide strength, kindness, and a great courage of conviction. Now is an important time to reaffirm our commitment to diversity and inclusion and to denounce racism.

Keep diversity, equity, and inclusion at the top of the agenda.
As we work to reimagine our university in the midst and in the wake of the pandemic, we must make sure we don’t pull back our focus on justice. We know that the agenda has never been longer, and our priorities are many. But, as a community, we need to keep justice as a top priority. As an international community, our commitment to equity and diversity is international in scope.

Pull together your communities to have conversations of understanding.
One of the things I’ve learned from our beloved community is how often fear is a part of the everyday experience for members of historically underrepresented and socially marginalized groups. Running errands, driving to work, jogging or walking in a park are activities that for some people can quickly become dangerous situations of confrontation, denunciation, or death. While we can’t be together in person, we must be intentional in having these conversations virtually, whether to give voice to the fears and frustrations many are feeling or to offer support. Please consider holding conversations of understanding in your units, departments, and among your circle of family and friends in the coming weeks. To help facilitate these conversations, the Office of Diversity, Engagement and Community Outreach (DECO) has resources available for you and your colleagues, and new ones will be added next week.

One final thought
Each one of us has the immense opportunity to make choices each day that either make our university and our world more inclusive and equitable — or not. As USF lives through this summer of remote work and study, as we prepare for very difficult financial challenges brought on by COVID-19, as we prepare to return to campus in the fall, there has never been a more crucial time for us to use our influence to lead and acknowledge that being outraged without action is not enough. We need to roll up our sleeves and help each other navigate this increasingly complex social environment, allowing the light of our ideals to show us the way forward, together. 

Thank you for all you do.

You are in my prayers.

Sincerely,

With heavy hearts, we mourn the horrific killing of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer while three other officers stood by in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our thoughts go out to Floyd’s family and to the families of all those who have been the victims of violent murders fueled by racism and hatred in our country. These events are a stark reminder of the dark divisions that continue to run through our society, the legacy of a dark past that we have not yet fully reconciled. We must acknowledge these divisions and commit to becoming a more just and equitable society.

We stand in solidarity with the African American community, as these events have only compounded the sense of grief, fear, and loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here as well, we are reminded of the systemic biases that shape our realities. It is our collective responsibility to challenge these institutional inequities and to demand better for ourselves and for future generations.

As Gamecocks, let us be leaders in these efforts. Our Carolinian Creed calls on us to respect the dignity of all persons, to respect the rights and property of others, to discourage bigotry, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions. Violence and hateful rhetoric are not reflective of these values. If we are to begin the process of healing the wounds of racism, hate and bigotry that have brought us to this current tipping point, we must engage one another in thoughtful dialogue about our individual and collective experiences. We must do the work of educating ourselves about the harmful impact of racism and discrimination in all of its manifestations.

Anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training are currently provided to UofSC faculty and staff and required of all students who are new to the Columbia campus. And multiple units are engaged in advancing diversity and inclusion initiatives across our campus. However, given this pivotal moment in which we find ourselves, we will intensify these efforts to ensure that we are equipping our students, faculty and staff with the tools needed to effectively navigate the current tensions in our society. To this end, we are assembling a team to work on the implementation of a new diversity module that will be required of all UofSC freshmen as part of their orientation process beginning in the 2020-2021 academic year. And we will amplify the training available to all students, faculty and staff to ensure that we have the resources needed to foster a campus culture that is reflective of our Creed.

In his 1963 “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. acknowledged the “interrelatedness of all communities and states,” noting that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.” Let us turn our anger into action, demanding justice where there is injustice, peace where there is violence, and love where there is hate. Let the suffocation of this moment be the impetus for change.

I believe I speak for the entire University of South Florida community when I express our deep sadness over recent events in Minneapolis and around the country. The deaths of two black men, George Floyd in Minneapolis and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, should prompt us to pause and think about how racism impacts all of our lives.

Although neither of those individuals were affiliated with the University of South Florida, events such as this have a powerful impact on people of every background and in every community. The impact is magnified in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has so badly shaken us all.

As we work to help each other understand what has happened -- if we can ever truly understand -- I find myself reflecting on the Principles of Community we aspire to at USF; to treat each other with respect and dignity, refrain from displays of inappropriate anger or intimidating conduct, shun epithets or abusive language, find effective means to disagree, and to persuade and to inform through dialogue.

For our students, faculty and staff, I want to remind them of the resources available through the university’s Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Equal Opportunity, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the USF Counseling Center. I urge you to seek out their support.

I believe we must support and care for each other during times like these and not forget that each of us is empowered to stand up to injustice whenever and wherever it occurs.

Thank you.

George Floyd’s death was captured on video and shared with a world already on edge.

Whether it’s on a Minneapolis street in 2020 or in a Tulsa elevator in 1921, the legacy of racism is deep, pervasive and intolerable.

You, the members of our university community, have a choice. You can choose to recognize bias – in yourself and others – and have the personal courage to call it out. You can be vigilant and vocal. You can be an agent for positive change and an advocate for those at risk of being marginalized. Although we are apart, we are not alone.

In a week that was marked by the awful death toll from covid-19 exceeding 100,000, and the ranks of unemployed Americans swelling past 40 million, the incomprehensible killing of one individual still moved the nation. A friend of mine said she was just feeling numb. I have personally struggled to process the senseless actions on that video. 

I do not have words of wisdom to share, or to explain the unexplainable. But I do know that we are all diminished when a lack of opportunity, coupled with fear and life-threatening circumstances, prevent the development of potential. 

As a citizen, husband, father and friend, I stand in solidarity with all who are saddened and outraged by the events of this week. And as an educator, promoting a sense of safety and belonging among all our students and our community is foremost on my mind. 

I acknowledge our shared responsibility to work toward a better tomorrow. A tomorrow where we feel compassion toward one another, and there is justice toward those who still suffer within our country. 

Decades ago, Langston Hughes had to remind us that “I, too, am America”. Let us not wait for further reminders. 

And at this time of pain, let us look out for each other and offer support and kindness… widely and unconditionally.

This anger demands meaningful action, particularly for those of us who are in positions of privilege.

I recognize that words condemning the tragic and inexcusable death of George Floyd are not enough. UWPD Chief Kristen Roman and her fellow Dane County chiefs are already engaged with the community to reduce trust gaps and improve safety through the Law Enforcement and Leaders of Color Collaboration. I appreciate the work that UWPD has done to ensure that its training and policies protect and serve our communities of color as effectively as they protect and serve other members of our community.

Our work extends beyond law enforcement to every facet of our institution. Although most of us cannot physically be on campus because of the coronavirus, we continue to work on creating a more inclusive and diverse community through the efforts of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement; admissions and recruitment; faculty/staff recruitment and retention; Student Affairs; Human Resources, our schools and colleges as well as within individual departments and units.

Each of us – particularly those of us who do not face the daily challenge of living amid inequity and injustice – must contribute to and lead the change that is needed. There are many ways to become more aware and involved. A list of resources is available on the DDEEA website.

Our campus has a long and proud tradition of helping bring about lasting change through peaceful protest. Thousands of people gathered peacefully at the Capitol Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately, a small number chose to engage in destructive acts that attacked already-struggling local businesses. I condemn this violence; it drowns out the message that needs to be heard and is likely to create backlash and more anger on all sides, rather than promote the changes that are needed.

I urge anyone participating in protests to engage in peaceful activism that drives towards systemic change. Use the power and privilege of your education to speak up, reject hate, racism and violence and use respect to build our community. Please take care for your own safety and those around you in this time of COVID-19.

Finally, I encourage those who are anxious or angry about recent national events to connect with the campus resources that are here to support you. These include the Multicultural Student Center, DDEEA, University Health Services and the Employee Assistance Office.

To our Black and Brown students, staff and faculty, I want to say unambiguously: You belong here, you are important to this campus, your lives matter and I am committed to your safety.

Vassar College,,3,3,https://president.vassar.edu/community/2020/200529-a-message-from-the-president.html,"Dear all, 

After reading the news of George Floyd’s death, I am horrified. And I wish I could say I was surprised. As the days have gone by, and we see video, and hear more from witnesses and his family, the news continues to be grim. The images and the story bring back so many other incidents—the violent deaths of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, and what happened in Central Park with Christian Cooper. These events are all too common in our country, historically and today. 

From shouts of “hands up” reminding us of Michael Brown, to the gut-wrenching plea of “I can’t breathe” that will forever bring up memories of Eric Garner, this is all too terrifyingly familiar. Like after the death of Sandra Bland, the community is expressing outrage over the injustices that continue to occur in our communities. We have heard before that things will change, but this is one of those weeks when I can’t help but feel that things have not changed. 

At these times I worry about colleagues and neighbors. Are they afraid to go on a run by themselves? I worry about students, who may be wondering, could this happen to me? And I worry for the fragile fabric of our community, which—acknowledging our national and own institutional history—we are trying, with great effort, to strengthen. 

That all of this is coming at a time when our nation should be standing together to fight a powerful and elusive virus makes it all the more devastating—particularly as we know that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities are disproportionately dying from COVID-19, and Asians and Asian Americans have experienced increased discrimination during this pandemic. Tragedies like the death of George Floyd remind us that we still have an equally insidious and lethal force—racism—tearing our social fabric. 

I do not have an answer for how to keep this from happening in our world. But we might each ask ourselves how we can help end the cycles of violence that we see perpetuated against members of our human family. Wherever you are physically in the world right now, you might call a friend. Talk about the pain you are feeling, or offer words of strength if you can. Reach out to one of the many organizations that are developing a response to the violence committed against George Floyd and so many others. Each one of these black lives mattered.

Just breathe.

It sounds simple enough. As our Biology and Nursing faculty would easily remind us, it’s a basic human function—something most of us do instinctively and without labor. It’s also something we usually take for granted; a given you could say. However, as these past few months have shown us with COVID-19, and this past week with the senseless death of George Floyd, it’s also something precious, something to be protected and something to which every human being is entitled.

I can’t help but compare the two situations. With COVID-19, we witnessed what was occurring and swiftly and dramatically changed behaviors in order to save lives. As I think about George Floyd, and the numerous other black men and women who have been killed unjustly, I can’t help but wonder, why isn’t our reaction the same? When will we understand that injustice affects us all? Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said it best when he said: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”

No matter how empathic I want to be, I have come to understand that the experience of race in America has made it impossible for me to comprehend fully how incidents like the death of George Floyd affect our black students, faculty, staff and alumni. I do, however, want these Villanovans to know that I share in their anger, their frustration, their pain and their sorrow. I stand ready to support them however I can. No one should live a life stifled by racism. All human life is sacred. 

I call on all of us to look honestly at ourselves and see the times when our actions, interactions and reactions fall short of our best intentions. We need to examine where we have succeeded, where we have failed and where can we actively work together to improve—and commit to improving. To do this takes time, energy and commitment, but given what continues to happen around us, I believe it’s imperative that we try harder. We need to reach out beyond our comfort zone and engage in conversations on important subjects that matter.

Soon, we will emerge from self-isolation and when we do, I ask that our actions always be indicative of our Augustinian values of veritas, unitas and caritas. May our interactions be more thoughtful, more open, more understanding, more inclusive and more kind. May our reactions to issues, challenges and obstacles be more appropriate and less complacent. And let us pray that these become consistent, and as natural and innate as each breath we take.

The deaths of Mr. Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, Georgia, and Mr. George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, join a long 
and unfortunate history of traumatic episodes in our nation that heighten our awareness of systemic racial injustices. 
Coupled with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and its disproportionate harms for marginalized populations, it’s 
imperative we rethink how we work, communicate, and remain committed to our values as a university. 
For all of us committed to equity and inclusion, the pain is real. The anger, fear, and frustration are real. And yet, I

The University of West Georgia is guided by our fundamental commitment to the wellbeing of all members of our campus

together, bound by shared values, we activate the transformative power of education. We equip each other with the 
knowledge, skills, and capacity to make a more just and equitable society. We do this together because we cannot 
overcome the challenges in our future alone. 
I grew up in Flint, Michigan. Over the weekend, like in many cities throughout the United States, people gathered there to 
express their anger, fear, and frustration in light of events past and present related to police conduct and systemic racial

police and residents of Flint, Sheriff Swanson took the opportunity to stand in shared value. The sheriff removed his 
helmet and said of himself and his fellow officers, “The only reason we are here is to make sure you have a voice.” As the 
crowd began to chant “Walk with us,” he said, “Let’s go.” Everyone walked together. 
At a moment in which anger, fear, and frustration were at the forefront of so many people’s lives, they found a way to

Racism looms over our nation’s soul.

Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. George Floyd. Three on a seemingly endless list of African American fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, loved ones, and family members, all of whom were killed because they were black.

Each a recent and stark reminder and memorial of the ugliness of historic, systemic inequality.

Each a victim of our country’s severe racial and class disparities.

The COVID?19 pandemic has laid bare the truth about the unequal access to health care that people of color—specifically African Americans—face. This fact only compounds the current outrage.

We are still so far from achieving the aspirations of racial and social justice.

How do we acknowledge the atrocity and pain of past and recent tragedies? How, especially, do we acknowledge and respond to the ongoing racism suffered by African American students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community members when they aren’t treated with the humanity and dignity they deserve?

Given the recent killings and the protests and destruction of the past few days, the words of Martin Luther King Jr. offer a truth worth repeating. In a 1967 speech in which Dr. King referenced the nationwide riots of that summer, he said:


. . . .riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so, in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.


Black lives matter. Racial violence impacts our WSU family. As an intellectual community committed to learning and seeking truth, we must reflect on our own failures—individually and collectively.

In that spirit, we soon will release a report from an investigation into WSU police arrest rates that illustrates we have much work to do. We, like Bill Gardner, chief of university police, are committed to confronting this issue and will, in dialogue with the WSU community, work toward a just solution.

Change starts with each of us, and we must hold ourselves and each other accountable.

We must consider our own roles in maintaining systemic racism and accepting racial violence, even when it makes us uncomfortable. When our actions are informed by the truth of others, we can move forward, together, courageously and realize the aspirations of racial and social justice. Only then can we begin to create an authentic space from which to proceed.

Washington University in St Louis,,5,5,https://andrewdmartin.wustl.edu/on-racial-equity-and-justice/,"Dear Washington University community,

To say that this has been a difficult and painful week would be an extreme understatement. Like you, I’ve watched with sadness and grief as events have unfolded first in Minneapolis in response to the killing of George Floyd, and then across the country as individuals and communities have taken to the streets to express their anger and frustration at the racial injustice that continues to plague our nation. The ongoing racial violence that we are witnessing against people of color is nothing short of devastating. In recent months, we have seen a rise in anti-Asian and anti-Asian-American violence, largely perpetuated by other Americans. In the last two weeks, we have seen the continuation of violence against Black Americans, both at the hands of officers of the state and private individuals. The events of the past several days reflect only the most recent in a long line of wrongs that have been inflicted upon our communities of color. 

Here in St. Louis, we are all too familiar with the refrain of those who are committed to addressing issues of inequality and racism – “No justice, no peace.” Given our commitment to activism and social justice, it’s no surprise that the St. Louis community has joined the call to action, and I’m heartened to see the passion that drives our friends and neighbors to make their voices heard. I also am deeply concerned for the well-being of our community and remain committed to working toward a constructive path forward in our region that tackles structural disparities and inequities.

I’ve spent a lot of time this weekend thinking, and engaging in conversation with other university leaders, about how we can best support our community and advance the cause of racial justice during this time – what we could say or do that would bring comfort to those who are hurting, and show solidarity with those who are taking action. Given the enormity of the issues before us, we know without question that words are not enough, and that no “statement” will begin to resolve the tremendous challenges that are still before us. And yet, there are some things that are important to say.

First, we must acknowledge those who are suffering. To our students, faculty, staff, and any other members of our community who are feeling targeted, unheard, or unsupported, we see you and are here for you. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion means more than just welcoming every person into our community. It means valuing you as individuals with your own identities, actively acknowledging that you matter, and unwaveringly supporting your right to be treated fairly and equally in every aspect of our society. We stand with you and condemn all acts of hate, aggression, or disrespect toward any racial group that may happen anywhere in our community, our region, our country, or the world. We are committed to supporting all members of our community, and we must redouble our efforts to achieve the equity that is foundational to fostering this environment.

In addition, we remain committed to making a difference. After the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014, our Washington University community began the long process of looking inward, to see how we could create space for honest dialogue about race, ethnicity, inequality, and social justice, how we could “do better and be better.” Since that time, we have taken steps as a community to become more fully engaged on these issues, and to work toward positive change. At our most recent Day of Dialogue and Action this spring, we reaffirmed our commitment to creating “intentional spaces to listen, extend empathy, celebrate, and engage in dialogue” in hopes of reflecting on our own humanity and the humanity of others. The events of this week are a painful reminder of how much work we all still have to do, as a nation and as a society.

Finally, we must take action. This includes not only supporting our community, but also doing what is at the core of our mission: leveraging our activities in support of research, teaching, and patient care to make a difference in helping to forward the cause of racial and social justice in our community, our region, and around the world. Already some of our schools have announced initiatives aimed at improving racial equity, especially focusing on racial violence. We anticipate announcing additional initiatives in the coming weeks.

The separation of our community due to the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an additional strain on our ability to come together to support, listen to, and learn from one another. We are all struggling with the disconnection from our peers, friends, and support networks, especially during this time of additional stress. But this only makes our need to create space for engagement within our community even more urgent, and we are working toward ways to do that in the days ahead. In the short-term, please stay tuned for invitations to opportunities to participate in observances and events that our leaders are currently planning. In the longer-term, we continue to listen and engage with members of our community to work toward substantive, mission-oriented action that we will take institutionally to make our city and our world beacons of opportunity for all. 

In these incredibly difficult times, I know there are no words that will be enough. But it’s important for you to know that as a community, we are united in our commitment to justice and racial equity.

Sincerely,

Andrew D. Martin

Wofford College,,0,0,https://www.wofford.edu/about/news/news-archives/2020/a-message-from-president-samhat,"Dear Wofford family, 

At Wofford College, diversity, equity and inclusion are core values, and our community is stronger for our differences. Thus, it is imperative at this time of pain and dissension throughout our country that we recommit ourselves to these values as well as a culture of mutual respect and civil discourse. 

Wofford’s mission calls for each of us to make positive contributions to a global society, fostering commitment to excellence in character, performance, leadership, service to others and lifelong learning. Let us use this moment to respond to current events as our mission instructs us. Listen to the concerns and frustrations of our neighbors. Develop the courage to speak against racism, bigotry and hate. Engage with respect, civility and empathy. 

The past several months have revealed much about our nation and world. And while we look forward to returning to some kind of normal after this pandemic, the lives of those who have been killed or wrongfully accused, the families who continue to seek justice and the communities that continue to suffer remind us that we collectively have a responsibility to pursue a normal that reflects the values of our nation: justice, liberty and equality for all. 

Let us strive together to achieve these ends, for we must not tolerate anything less as a nation and world. 

Stay well.

Xavier University,https://www.xavier.edu/now/graham-letter-grief-and-unrest,6,6,https://www.xavier.edu/now/graham-letter-grief-and-unrest,"Dear Members of the Xavier University Community:

Not quite four months after I became Xavier’s president, Timothy Thomas became only the most recent in a long line of black men to die at the hands of Cincinnati police officers. The city soon exploded in grief and anger and unrest, and a curfew was declared. And now, as I prepare to enter into my final year as Xavier’s president more than 19 years later: another death of a black man at the hands of police (although this time in Minneapolis), more exploding unrest in Cincinnati and elsewhere and yet another curfew. A long, dark line connects these two events separated by 19 years, a line written in the blood of black bodies, dead at the hands of officers and others. The most recent names on that line before George Floyd’s were those of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. And stretching back before Timothy Thomas, in 2001—how many exactly? Who and when? For that line extends through the mass incarceration of today to the heyday of lynching to the chattel slave system of the antebellum United States whose legacy our country has yet to outgrow. Seems in fact—too often—to be unwilling to outgrow.

How to respond to these recent events, but to the death of George Floyd most especially? Anger and outrage? To be sure. How can we not? But if you are like me (sadly, I must say it), not with surprise. I should be angered and outraged that I am no longer surprised, and at one level I am. But at another I am just deeply, deeply sad. 

Another response of ours of course must be to the civil unrest that has spun so out of control in so many places. Here we must be careful. For on the one hand we see boiling out long pent-up outrage; we must listen to and learn from it although that outrage itself does great violence wrongly and we are right to call that out. But worse: Some hijack the grief of others for their own dark purposes, destroying the work and livelihoods of those they claim to stand with and protect. Their behaviors deserve our full-throated condemnation if for no other reason (and there are many other reasons) than what they do allows others to change the subject and not talk about the deeply ingrained, systemic structures of racism that riddle our society, and to talk instead about ""the looters."" Just as they changed the subject when Colin Kaepernick took a knee during our National Anthem to protest what we just saw happen again last week in Minneapolis, and his constitutionally protected act of symbolic speech was derided as an insult to our flag and our people in service. Would George Floyd have died, do you think, if we had listened differently to Colin Kaepernick? As well, our police forces and other agencies charged with keeping order must take great care always that their actions never escalate already great tensions. 

One additional response might be, indeed must be, to realize that whatever we have been doing to address this original sin of our country, it has not been enough. Campus dialogues following the civil unrest of 2001 led to much, and chief among what it led to was a broad institutional pivot into being a part of our Cincinnati community in a way Xavier had never been before, especially with and for the marginalized. More recently, I am proud of the work we have been doing since Dr. Janice Walker became our Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, especially as that work has been creatively extended and multiplied through the efforts of Dr. Kyra Shahid, the Director of the CDI (Center for Diversity and Inclusion). Our grappling with our own University's tangled early history with institutional slavery has led to much since Dr. Walker Gollar helped bring it to light several years ago. The Working Group on Xavier’s Connection to Slavery, shaped in response to Dr. Gollar’s work, has served us well in many ways, from last fall’s Universities Studying Slavery symposium to the work that artist-in-residence Angela Franklin is currently completing that will soon grace our Conaton Board Room. And these are only several of the long, long list of initiatives that Dr. Walker has overseen in her work on the strategic plan for institutional diversity and inclusion she put together several years ago (with the assistance of many of you) and is now bringing to fruit (again, with your good assistance). I would like finally to mention under this heading that three distinguished scholars will be joining us this coming fall ?as full members of a new department that will house Sociology and our Gender and Diversity Studies program: Drs. ShaDawn Battle, Mich Yonah Nyawalo and Kayla Wheeler. Their coming to us at this particular time feels to me like providence.

But whatever we have done until now must be acknowledged by all in light of present events as the early steps of a long journey. And so I recommend to us all the various campus resources and engagement opportunities which Drs. Walker and Shahid have collected here. Important as our own efforts must be to open our eyes more fully to the implicit biases which stain us all, that we might better harness whatever privilege we enjoy on behalf of those not privileged in the ways we are, that much more important must our efforts be for our students whose educations will someday make possible the birth of the just society toward which we lean in hope, but whose full coming we will not, I fear, live to see ourselves.

A concluding reflection on the day I write these words. As a Catholic priest, I mark Pentecost Sunday today with other Christians. We regard it as the birthday of the Christian Church. Perhaps you know its story: A mighty wind seized a house, and the timid and confused followers of Jesus were transformed by the Spirit’s fire into mighty disciples who stopped at nothing, not even their own deaths, to spread the Good News they had been given. The Greek word we translate as “Spirit”—pneuma—is likewise the word that means “breath.” The juxtaposition today is haunting. In the Gospel reading proper to today’s feast in my tradition, Jesus gives his spirit to his disciples by breathing on them. But George Floyd couldn’t breathe. And so we recognize the birth of the Christian Church once again this year at this very moment. Whoever we are and whatever tradition we follow, let us all redouble our efforts at building a world of justice, of love, of mercy and of peace. A world where God’s children, one and all, may freely and deeply breathe.

Yale University,Ivy League,3,3,https://president.yale.edu/speeches-writings/statements/memory-george-floyd,"Dear Members of the Yale Community, 

I write to you today deeply upset by the killing of George Floyd while he was in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. Mr. Floyd’s death follows a pattern of racial injustice that has become too familiar in our country and that amounts to a national emergency. 

At a time when the American community must come together more than ever before, George Floyd’s horrifying death shocks our shared conscience and indicts our shared failure. It can and must remind us of other similar killings and of the racism, nativism, and bigotry too pervasive in society today and throughout our country’s history. 

Over the past week, I have been thinking about two seemingly incongruous things—our sense of community and one of our most basic emotions: fear. 

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, legitimate fear has been very much with us, but not just about the virus itself, and not among us equally. From reports of racism against people of Asian descent to the unacceptable disparities in health outcomes and health care, there was every reason for us to fear for the safety of our neighbors and family members, and of some, sadly, more than of others. 

At the same time, I saw nurses, doctors, support staff, and volunteers act with courage, selflessness, and compassion in our home city and around the world. We nurtured a growing sense of community, which gave us the optimism and hope that must ever be a cornerstone of our beloved country. It is in the face of that noble expression of solidarity that George Floyd’s death has shaken us and the shared spirit of heroism we have aroused to fight the pandemic. 

As I read the news reports of Mr. Floyd’s death and its explosive response, I knew that many members of our community feel fear in their daily lives because of the injustices they have experienced and witnessed, and I thought of how fear so reliably leads to anxiety, depression, health deterioration, and anger, and also to aggression and even violence. Some of the protests have turned destructive, undermining the plea for justice all Americans must share. Fear is powerful, damaging, and unpredictable in its effects. 

I believe that all of us at Yale must do what we can to replace fear with hope—and not with anything less than action. Here I have been thinking much of the life of the extraordinary Pauli Murray, a lawyer, civil rights leader, and Yale Law School graduate. She experienced firsthand the cruelties of racial segregation and suffered injustices. She knew fear. However, she wrote in her memoir, “Seeing the relationship between my personal cause and the universal cause of freedom released me from a sense of isolation…I would be no less afraid to challenge the system of racial segregation, but the heightened significance of my cause would impel me to act in spite of my fears.” 

I have implored myself—and earnestly invite you to do the same— to make direct use of Pauli Murray’s wisdom. Her words remind us of all that we have been able to accomplish together because of our shared commitment to the common good. Since mid-March, we have saved lives in this pandemic. We have isolated ourselves, changed the way we live, and sacrificed to safeguard the well-being of the most vulnerable among us and prevent our hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. It is vital to remember that we have been united in easing suffering, improving lives, and providing hope during a turbulent and challenging period of our history. If we can do this, we are capable, all of us, of creating the America we must insist belongs to us all. 

In 1945, Pauli Murray wrote, “As an American I inherit the magnificent tradition of an endless march toward freedom and toward the dignity of all mankind.” We have so much more to do to foster and sustain an equitable society. Instead of feeling the isolating effects of fear when our sense of community is shaken, we must remember that we are connected in more ways than we are divided. And that where we are divided, we must work, now, in the interest of unity and justice. This is a matter of the highest importance. 

So, let us act as Pauli Murray would have us act toward those we know well but also those to whom we are connected simply by a common and powerful dream. I am grateful that you and I share Yale and its mission to improve the world today and for future generations. In looking forward to the work we have ahead of us, I wish you peace and strength. 

With best wishes for your health and safety,
